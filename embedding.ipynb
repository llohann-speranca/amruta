      "So, this energy is settled within us in the triangular bone. And it has to pass through six subtle centres. While the seventh centre is below the Kundalini. And this is the centre which is for all our excretion inclusive of sex. So, sex has nothing to do with your yoga. On the contrary when the Kundalini is rising all your excretory movements and excretory things just become dull or sleep. And then the Kundalini rises. It passes through all these six centres. She nourishes them. She integrates them and ultimately passes through here into limbic area which is a hollow place and pierces through the sixth centre here which we call as the brahmarandra meaning the hole of the Brahma the all-pervading Power and then enters into the subtle energy, which is controlling us, which is organising us which is doing all living work on this earth and in the whole universe. And also which loves us. This is how the connection takes place and this is what is yoga. Yoga also has another meaning is yukti. Yukti means the deftness. \n",

      "Or they took to the right side and suddenly any shock they can’t bear. So, they go to the left side. So, there’s no balance. And this balance is only established through Kundalini awakening. Of course, in one lecture I cannot tell you all about all these chakras. But I have told you about one chakra which is very important and extremely active in these modern times. And that is why Sahaja Yoga was so much needed in modern times. It had to work out all these diseases and so far, the news about AIDS is also good that the people whom we cured are still doing well in Perth. And I hope there will be more people of AIDS will come to Sahaja Yoga and will have that much will power to practice it and establish themselves again on this earth. \n",

      "Shri Mataji: No no. See the Kundalini is the primordial Mother. She does all the job. Mother only can have the patience. She can only have that love for her children. So the Mother we love is the climax of a women's life. She has to also mother her husband. But you could also become the Mother of the whole world. Or could be the Mother of the whole universe. So you can start expanding only from your children, you go on expanding because of pure love. So the man is the child of the mother. And the woman is the daughter of the mother. Now when they are marrying they are like two wheels of a chariot. Both are important. They are equal but not similar. Because the right side of the wheel has to be on the right side, the left has to be on the left side. Women are becoming more psychic, you can call more depressed these days because firstly they are very much dominating. Then they will react to that domination and try to put down men. But women are the powerful energies like the Mother Earth. Their power lies in giving everything. \n",

      "On the day of Chaturdashi, the Visarjan (immersing in water) of Ganapati takes place. Everyone did the Visarjan and came back. Among them some Evil-minded people were drunk, and they started dancing. And while dancing, they all caved-in the earth. But not even a single Sahaja Yogi in Latur was affected in any way. There houses were intact. Their family, their children all were intact. What is this if not a miracle? Same way you also understand that the protection of the God almighty will be on you because you are in his Kingdom. You have gone beyond all other Kingdoms, so you don't have to fear anything and nothing can destroy you. Like this, we have seen several examples happening in Sahaja Yoga, we have seen many people getting cured of many diseases. People who were taking drugs have changed overnight. People will be surprised How This can happen? This is what I told you that when Kundalini awakens inside us, all our shortcomings are destroyed. And this way Sahaja Yoga Is happening in many places. And people have started realising and understanding the need for transformation. Without this transformation nothing can change, and nothing can become alright. It is the human beings who spoils everything, and it is the same human beings who have to mend themselves and spread Sahaja Yoga. I have lot of trust in you that, as you people have spread this here, you will spread it even more, and many cities like this will be enlightened by Sahaja Yoga. My infinite blessings to you all.\n",

      "I would request you to understand the complications we have in the West. Now I am not facing an Indian talking. It’s all right for Me that is Eastern which is on the other side of it. Take it from Me. Eastern people have another problem, terrible problem they have. You see, and that is the different thing today I am facing you and that’s why I have to deal with/believe it is your problem as it is and see [if/which] I have seen, we can [unclear/which I have noticed, which I’ve heard, if we can work it. I have gone into everybody’s Kundalini to find out what’s the problem with these people. And that’s how I found out. So you have to humble down in your heart. If you have to evolve, really humble down in your heart. I’ve seen even the priests, even the people who try to preach, they are so ego-oriented. There is nothing like love in them. In the love also there is so much ego. See, love is full of good [unclear]. It doesn’t emit. All these things are there and the responsibility for them goes to our over-use of our ego. We have used it for our [struggle?]. Because of use of ego, our intellect, we think we can manage. But don’t try to fight the ego. If you try to fight it will sit on your head. The same ego is supported because through this ego only you are tired. You are fed up with yourself and you are not going to venture. If there was not sufficient ego you would not have been [like this/on this earth]. So you have felt it. Now you are going to manage it and it can be worked out. Not to hate yourself, because you have been egoistical. \n",

So this soul which is made of the five causal bodies and your centres, plus we can say, also it has got the control over the parasympathetic, it sits on the spinal cord from outside and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. So it has a connection with every centre. Now this is the soul when we die, with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky and it is the soul that guides now the movement of our being, whatever is left now into a new being and that’s how it works out. So everything that we have done so far is recorded in that soul. When you were asking Me, “Mother, we see some sort of round, round things, you see, lying together. What is that?” I told you this is our, this is a dead soul. And now they have found out what I have told them. Because, you see, when a person dies his soul shows you – like even now you can see, round, round things: there could be many, there could be one, a string – and they saw it under a microscope when I told them, that the soul within us is reflected on the cell, which is the reflector of every cell. So the part of the cell which is the reflector, which is placed on one side of the cell also has this soul reflected, and the main soul which is on the back controls that reflected soul which looks after every cell. Now they have found out that there is in that reflector this kind of seven loops, seven loops because it sits on the eight, seven chakras and the Mooladhara.\n",

Please close your eyes and take out your spectacles. Be comfortable. Put both the feet straight parallel on the Mother Earth like this because you have to take the help of the Mother Earth. Left Swadisthan. All right. So please now put your left-hand towards Me like this and close your eyes and don't open your eyes till I tell you, because attention has to be drawn inside, which you will not feel, but if your eyes are open Kundalini may not rise. So please keep your eyes closed. It's very relaxing, extremely relaxing. Now put your left-hand on your lap very comfortably. If there's anything tight on your body, which makes you uncomfortable you can loosen it. Be comfortable, that's important. But that doesn't mean you should slouch or you should bend too much. You have to sit straight as much as is comfortable with your head straight.\n",

The right side has the ‘power of action’. We shall clear our chakras with the right hand. First of all, we will keep our right hand on our heart. I have already told you that our heart reflects our Spirit. After that, we will keep our right hand on the left side of our upper abdomen.

And once you are realised, you can also awaken the Kundalini. But spontaneously it will be awakened. I, when I was born, I knew My mission. I knew what I had to do and that I had to find out a method, en-masse realisation. And in My own meditative way, I studied human beings, what are their problems, why can't they have en-masse realisation. Because any discovery, unless and un it is made public, available to everyone, has no meaning. So many people have been killed, given poisons and tortured, and the time had come also for Me to do the job and somehow I've managed it. But you can also give realisation to people once you're realised. \n",

One had to have the vision that, when a human being is created, how an incarnation can help him. At different levels, we had incarnations on this Earth and they were sent with a particular idea that they should achieve a particular type of ascent in that particular time. They were all part and parcel of the Primordial Mother and they all had a very powerful Kundalini built within them. But the incarnation of this Kali Yuga is very complicated.

      "So that's how they had to adjust according to society according because such people had to break those concepts to put the right things into their heads. Like a little root take goes inside the Mother Earth and when it finds any obstruction it goes around it and establishes there itself. Human beings though are the epitome of creation very hard, but cannot understand the truth, they cannot understand the truth that it exists in a way that we have to feel it on the central nervous system. Because they were not realised souls, they have crucified Christ, they have given poison to Mohammed, they have tortured people because they did not know what a realised soul is. And how much could Christ talk about it, because they didn't allow him to live long? You will be amazed in England where people are supposed to be wise and intelligent, I thought so, for four years I was struggling with seven people. They didn't crucify me, no, but argued so much that I was really exhausted with them. There is no argument about it, it has to work out, the system that we had in before was to clear out every centre gradually and put the person in such a way that he achieves his realisation. But now Sahaja Yoga has become much easier than what even Kabira talked about sixteen century, sixteen-seventeen century. Because the seventh centre is now broken, so it is very easy to raise your Kundalini put through your seventh centre so that you can see for yourself what's a wrong little bit at least. And once that happens, once that happens when you start seeing for yourself what's wrong with you and you correct yourself, you become your own masters. Of course, when the Kundalini rises the first boon you get is your physical wellbeing.\n",

      "So photograph is much more powerful than any other statue. Moreover, it is a reproduction, no doubt, but reproduction of reality, with five elements. So I shouldn’t call it just a representative, it’s quite me. Because my attention is there. We have experimented with this. The Sharayu Gadkary had a photograph of mine and her relation came to her and she used to mock at the photograph and say all kinds of things. She brought the photograph to me showing that it had become all dark, black. So I said, ‘Who was there?’ She said, ‘It’s my, some relation who had come she used to do like this. It has become black.’ I said, ‘You’d better put it in the sea now. My attention is not there, no vibrations. My attention has come away, receded from there, I can see that. You should not have put the photograph like that.’ So there’s a very big difference between a statue and a photograph, because my attention is there. Of course, even the statues which are, I mean the ones which are Swayambhu, which are created by Mother Earth, also has vibrations and they also show that they have vibrations, but they cannot give you awakening of the Kundalini, because My photograph has got My desire, also, in it. They cannot. If they could have, Stonehenge would have. \n",

Because in the beginning it's a very thin, just like your hair; the energy flows on to the top of your head, and then, when it opens it a little bit, the Grace falls onto your sympathetic nervous system, relaxes your chakras, and then more energy starts flowing, but you can help later on to raise your Kundalini more.

This happening of Kundalini, is so eminent today that it is happening to thousands of people. For example, the whole of Europe, I've been traveling and I find there are so many seekers of truth -special category of human beings. They are just ready to get their realisation. It is to happen now. This is the time which is described as Last Judgment.\n",

No. This Mahamaya had to come on this earth, not the Adi Shakti in Her purest form, it's too much. So, She was covered with this Mahamaya. Now you see, in nineteen years what we have achieved. So many yogis are sitting in front of Me. The difference between a saint and a yogi is that the saint himself is righteous, himself is holy, but he doesn't know much about the Kundalini. But the yogi knows about the Kundalini. The difference between a yogi and a Sahaja Yogi is, that a Sahaja Yogi has powers, Sahaja Yogini has powers to give realisation to others. A yogi can cleanse himself, but he cannot cleanse others, while a Sahaja Yogi can cleanse others and cleanse himself.\n",

      "Alright, the second point, second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Forgive everyone without even thinking about them. Because, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. When you don’t forgive, then of course you play into wrong hands. And torture yourself for nothing at all. While the person whom has troubled you, whom you are not forgiving, is enjoying life nicely. So, why carry on with this myth? Specially at this moment, is very important that you forgive everyone without thinking about them. Because thinking about them also causes headache. Moreover, at this important moment, the centre on the optic-chiasma is constricted like this, absolutely. And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open [shows cross with fingers closed and then square-shaped opening]. And, how will this Kundalini then go through it? So please, just say in your heart that ‘I forgive everyone’ without even thinking about them[?], in general. I have already told you that you have to have full self-confidence that you all will get your realisation here, tonight. Also, if you don’t mind, please take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Some people are even attached to their shoes, you know [laughs].\n",

      "Shri Mataji: Now, Kundalini, you may not have heard about it because the word Kundalini you might not have heard. But it is nothing but the Holy Ghost within you, the Holy Ghost about which every Christian has heard. Now, they do not know much about it. That’s a different point. But Holy Ghost is the power within us, which is the power of desire to be one with the Divine. And this power is actually the primordial Power, which has created this Universe and has created us through our evolution and has brought us to this point where we are human beings, and now we have to become something more. So this power is not yet manifested; that’s why it is called as a sleeping power. And that is placed in our sacrum bone. Imagine: it is called sacrum in Greek language. That means Greek knew that it was a sacred bone. And in that sacred bone it is very nicely placed and when somebody who is authorized, not by any Church or by any Hindu temple or anything, but authorized as a being, as an awareness, as a, we can say a divine personality, can raise this Kundalini like the sprouting of a seed. It’s a, it’s a living process. It’s a living process. And the living process can spontaneously happen only if there is somebody who has that power to do it. Like the Mother Earth has a power to sprout a seed. In the same way, somebody must have that power to sprout it. And it just arises and awakens within you the different centres, ultimately coming out of your fontanel bone area, which is on top of your head, and actualizes your baptism. Actually it’s a happening which is a living happening and not a dead happening that we just say, 'I baptize you.'\n",

      "When the whole world sleeps a Sahaj Yogi is awake and when the world is awake a Sahaja Yogi sleeps-‘ This means that those things towards which a Sahaj Yogi is inclined, other people are not inclined. They are inclined towards other things. In some way or the other they are disinclined (vimukh) from the truth Someone is caught up with money, someone with power, they are caught up with one thing or another and are completely lost; away from the truth. They cannot see the truth Someone will say this is the reason, someone will say that is the reason, some explanation or the other. However I think, God knows what all a man does in his ignorance A sort of darkness envelops. Like for example, if this place is plunged into darkness, God knows there might be a stampede, people may fall, get trampled over, anything can happen When we are in this darkness we are asleep. But when we are awake, when our Kundalini is awakened and when we are confronted with the truth, nobody can explain the beauty of truth. I asked somebody what did you get out of Sahaja Yoga? He said, ‘I can’t tell you what I got but I have got everything.’ What does everything mean? I will also say that today, in Sahaj, I have got everything. When I was small, I used to tell my father that it is my desire that, like the stars in the sky, many people on earth should also shine and spread the light of God. He said, it is possible you can find a method for en masse awakening; don’t give lectures, don’t write anything or else you will have a second Bible, a second Quran and there will be a thing to fight about. So, before this there should be en masse awakening and the task of en masse awakening has started in Sahaj. But, the problems of this, I have to discuss with you today. \n",

      "Now, how can you get cured? Because these centres are like this, and this is the left and the right sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic is in the centre but the limited amount of energy we have from the parasympathetic gets exhausted – then you get sick. But by Kundalini rising, the Force that is Eternal starts pouring into us, soothing us, and it supplies [energy]. Again they come back to normal and that is how people get cured. Yes I have cured cancer patients. Cancer can only be cured by Sahaja Yog – nothing else. This is a simple thing which doctors cannot accept; it is the over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system that causes cancer. Cancer came on this Earth since I was born, because of the wars and people started taking into sympathetic activities. Too much of sympathetic activity creates cancer, any kind. Then we can say even a sickness can create a sympathetic activity. Then people say, “It is due to cold [that] cancer has come, ” “It is due to rubbing of the nose it has come. ” It is not! It is an over-activity that has caused this cancer, and can be completely cured through Sahaj Yoga. But first of all you must get your Realisation. Without Realisation, you should not ask for curing. I mean, they are cured, no doubt but they can be cured, also by touching, it’s alright, but that’s important. \n",

Much before that Christ came on this Earth, as I told you yesterday, He is described very well fourteen thousands years back in Indian scriptures, believe Me. You don't want to believe in that, because You want to use this Bible for your purpose. Anybody who writes about Christ is taken over in the Bible, isn't it ? Like the disciples − they wrote about Christ. Christ never wrote Bible! But then why did You have Saint Paul there, who never even saw Christ? Because he said he saw a cross? Does that mean that he has ability to write about Christianity and Christ, that he should be in the Bible? Why people did not raise any objection to him, but they raise to Me? The reason is obvious. Because it helps certain purposes. I am for one purpose here: to give you what you have. In Switzerland you’ll understand better if I say that I am like a banker who has to cash your cheques.

Christ Himself in that short period has said that ‘Those who are not against Me are with Me.’ In these four years of His terrible struggle, how was He to talk of Kundalini to those fishermen who did not even know how to write. As I said yesterday, all these people are complementary to each other: because Christ did not say about this part so Mohammed said, ‘Your hands will speak.’ Christ has talked about the Last Judgement but Mohammed said it is better to talk about the Resurrection Time because Last Judgement will be coming later. Because as soon as some incarnation comes on this Earth everybody is out with a pistol toward that person. And they think only the suffering is due for them, they must suffer because they are saints. But you are the one who is making them suffer, so you are not a saint in any case, isn't it?\n",

      "This Kundalini is the reflection of that Adi Shakti, of that Ruh within us. This is the residual power, is the power of our ultimate desire which has not yet manifested. While in the Spirit, the God Almighty, our Creator, or whatever you may call Him by what name, is reflected as Spirit. Now in our awareness, whatever we have in our human awareness, we have so many understandings; like we can understand the colour, we can understand the smell. We understand there is dirt, there is filth. But the animals don’t. Animals have no sensation of it. But when you become a human being, you develop a sensation. Now when people say that you don’t commit murder, you don’t do this, all the Ten Commandments, one may ask why? Why? For what? Why should we do it? What is the advantage of doing all these things all your life for nothing at all? What is the advantage? Now to understand that there has to be a purpose for these things, Christ came on this Earth and many came on this Earth to say that to attain your eternal life, to attain your Spirit, you have to lead a certain type of life that gives a human sustenance.\n",

For example a person can be appointed as governor today and tomorrow he could be a beggar on the street. But not with divine authority. Whatever the properties nature have given are never taken away. Like water will remain water and the Mother Earth will remain Mother Earth. So when such a person who has an authority who comes on this Earth − like Christ or anyone − can spontaneously raise the Kundalini.\n",

Actually the Spirit is in the heart of the human beings. But the seat of the Spirit is on top of the head. So when the Kundalini rises and pierces through the fontanelle bone area here [Shri Mataji shows Her Sahasrara], then the Spirit gets the message. When She rises, She enlightens these different centres that are shown here, about which he has told you. You can see actually the pulsation of the Kundalini with your naked eyes. You can also see the rising of the Kundalini with your naked eyes in cases where people have obstruction. if there is no obstruction, Kundalini just shoots off in half of a, split of a second up to the head and goes out.

Like one great poet in England – William Blake – has said that the men of God will become prophets and these prophets will have powers to make others prophets.

He is the one who said, ‘A day will come when people will get their Kundalini awakening without any trouble and they will get their realisation.’ Not only that but he said this work will start in 1970.

And that's how, I have seen, people, say in Japan, they follow one religion, and in China they follow another religion. Both are just the same; one is Zen, another is Tao, but the misunderstanding is that they think: ‘We are exclusive’. They are not; none of them are exclusive. Mohammed Sahib described all of them: from Abraham to Moses, to Christ, to the Mother of Christ; and He said, ‘There have been more than one lakh nahbis on this Earth.’ But now, why to feel that we are exclusive? This exclusiveness comes from where? With Christ also He described all of them. Tao, the one religion that they follow in China is nothing but Sahaja Yoga − Tao is Kundalini. Zen is nothing but Sahaja; Zoroaster, everyone. But this exclusiveness has brought this problem and they are fighting among each other.\n",

You don't have to read anything. It's very simple. Also it has become very much simpler, because as I said this is a blossom time, as many of you have to ascend into that realm of complete reality.

You can feel them on your fingertips. And if you know how to decode what you are feeling on your fingertips, you know what they mean. It's an innate knowledge. You know about yourself, about your centres and also you know about others. Thus you jump into a new awareness, what we call as collective consciousness.

We become the eternal Spirit which was Lord Jesus Christ. And now the time has come when Mataji has taken Her birth, and we become a part and parcel of the whole.

      "So to happen this, there must be some happenings taking place. For example, when it rises, suddenly you see, when it crosses the second centre, it goes into a kind of, a kind of an augmentation there, so the Kundalini doesn’t fall off. That is called as bandhas. These bandhas, you see, the augmentation we can say, the closing of it. Then it goes higher, it starts closing these. It comes to the Vishuddhi Chakra – there the all energy has to be brought into play. So there’s a khechari happens, that the tongue little bit put here. But you won’t feel anything, it’s so fast. It’s so quick you won’t feel it. I mean I cannot give any other analogy like that, that even if you say, ‘Concorde,‘ I mean you do feel something about it, but supposing if you have a plane that you just board in [Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers] and you are there. It’s a split of a second the Kundalini [Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers again] can just shoot off. So you don’t feel any of these things, like, the whole Earth is so big, but you don’t see that it’s round. The circumference, in relation to thing that you see, is so small, that you don’t see it’s round. \n",

      "So, the Divine is the ’living’ being so it has to be a ‘living’ process. Like the sprouting of the seed, when you put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself. You cannot pay for it, you cannot order it, you cannot work it out. When you place the seed, it is built, within itself, all the maps that it is going to manifest. In the same way, within you, lies this instrument. In your heart resides the Spirit. Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. When this Kundalini rises, spontaneously, She becomes one with the Spirit, here, because the seat of the Spirit is on top of your head. This is the real baptism where you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your own head. You feel completely relaxed and peaceful. You can feel this all over. But more than that you become a new personality with collective consciousness that you can feel another personality on your fingertips. You can feel the other chakras just on the fingertips, even the children can feel it.\n",

I meet people who got realisation about, say, six years back and again they come to me and saying that, ‘Mother, I’m suffering from this trouble and that trouble.’ You have to know all about it and how to look after other people. In short you have to be a master of yourself and for others. Once it is established then you can manifest it and, the same way, you can raise the Kundalini of thousands of people and give them give the realisation. This is God’s work and is to be done with full respect to yourself that you are the instrument of God. The energy just flows. You need not even touch the person, even looking at the person you can help another personality to rise. So far, we have never used the power of love, only used the power of hatred. The power of love is the highest and the most dynamic and you will be amazed to see how fantastic you are when you are put to the mains, like this instrument which is all ready (the microphone), but if you don’t put to the mains it has no meaning. In the same way you are all made very beautifully and with great care. Please do not judge yourself, do not condemn yourself, and do not feel unworthy by any chance. It does not matter in what race, in what caste, in what community you are born. All of you can get your realisation. So, let us now come to the point of getting realisation.

And the Kundalini, though she has seven centres to pass through, the governing peethas, the seats, are in the peak, in the head, and so Adi Shakti takes place in the Sahasrara. She incarnates in the Sahasrara. So we can say that this is the Sahasrara of Maharashtra or of the Universe in a way, though Himalaya is regarded as the real abode of Sadashiva, which is on top. But the Sahasrara part, which is the limbic area, should be here because we have three and a half coils settled here. That's why the Kundalini of the Universe is here. But as the Saptashringi has come out of Mother Earth, this is the place where we can say resides the Sahasrara.\n",

Yet, what I want to tell is that ours is the Sahaja Yoga and being ‘Sahaja’ we feel, ‘If God is mine, he will deliver what I want at my seat.’ But the Yoga that happens spontaneously, Sahaja, is through the Kundalini awakening and the piercing of the Sahasrara and it is only to this extent that I owe you. Now, suppose you sow a seed in the earth, she is concerned with it only up to the stage when the seed sprouts. Thereafter, no care is necessary on the part of the earth. So, although it was then a spontaneous happening, but now we have become saints, we have become the seeds. However, this seems to be very difficult to understand. We always feel that we are the same persons. Even if we don't feel, our demeanours are just the same, and it should change. We should realise, that, now that we have become saints we should find out as to how many qualities of saints that Samarth Ramdas Swami and others have told are in us. Our attention should be on evolving them in us and we should find out as to why those qualities do not manifest in us, why the people cannot find them in us, what can be the reason for that.\n",

He said that, ‘Your hands will speak and they’ll give witness against you.’ Clearly, you see that. So let us face up to it. Where have we gone wrong? We have to seek our Spirit. In seeking the Spirit, also we had lots of people, fake people, who came here making money, because we are used to all religions where people make money, we never even doubted that how can they take money? God doesn’t understand money. He doesn’t understand your banks, He doesn’t know all these things that we do. It’s our headache.

You do not have to pay money to the Mother Earth. She doesn't understand. We understand that. She doesn't know money. In the same way, this living force, that is within you, is your own within yourself. We say [it] as the Kundalini because it has got coils, is the Mother- the Primordial Mother. We can call Her the Holy Ghost reflected within you. And for Her awakening, or for any such work which has to do with divinity, you cannot pay. You cannot also put in much effort because to become human beings, we have not put in much effort. In the same way, it happens so spontaneously that you don't have to worry about it. But as a result of that what happens to you is that you feel, for the first time, the truth that there is the all-pervading Power of divine love. Start feeling a cool breeze in your hands. And a Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost also comes out of your head, and you can feel it. And for the first time, you know that there is some subtler energy beyond what we know of.

And then ultimately, She breaks through the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood, giving you the actualisation. Again I say actualisation of baptism is described in all the religions. Now, on Easter, we give eggs to people. What is the significance of we giving- we are giving eggs to people, because Christ came on this Earth with a purpose. And His purpose [ was] that He should establish our resurrection, that He resurrected Himself. He is placed on this centre( Agyan), you see. Like this is the centre, is optic chiasma. And that is why… Because He was on this centre which looks after our eyes. He has said it, ‘Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.’ Why did He talk of eyes so much because He was placed on this optic chiasma. And when the Kundalini passes through, He is awakened within us. Then, He sucks these two institutions there, left and right, which we call as ego and superego where your karmas are there, your conditionings are there- all are sucked in. And then, the area which we call as limbic area, opens out like this. And through that, the Kundalini passes, and you get your Self-Realisation. \n",

Markandeya has professed about Me, that the Kundalini will pulsate at Her feet. There are many people who have seen the pulsations of Kundalini, have seen pulsation of thousands of people. It pulsates in the sacrum bone. We have taken films of these as well in London; this work is happening for many people in London. You can observe this pulsation when it is rising up. But for people who are not complicated and those who are pure, simple and straightforward, they don’t even realise when the Kundalini has risen. They reach thoughtless awareness and after that the divine vibrations start flowing through their palms. That is why I do My work mostly in the villages. I do not work in cities because there are a lot of impostors in the cities. The urban folks fall prey to these imposters. They want the impostors, need some circus. They do not need the truth. They want to participate in some or other circus. A villager is simple, straightforward and religious. We call this as spiritual sensitivity. During the time of Rama when He went for his exile in the forest, that time all poor people and all the people in His path, even while wandering in the forest, they knew that this is Shri Rama. Now we say that we have Ashtavinayaks over here and we have a role of the Ashtavinayaks. Who are these Ashtavinayaks? Ashtavinayaks are the divine elements that have evolved out of the Earth. Vinayak is a symbol of these. This is the biggest symbol. We must recognise it. It is the symbol of purity. \n",

If you misbehave with your mother, it is indeed a kind of an abuse. At least, every Indian should know how the Kundalini will be awakened if she is our mother. How God has created us in a very special way, transformed us from an amoeba to a human being and we didn’t even get to know.

First, this Kundalini rises, you see, above, because you see, when you put your hands towards Me or anybody who is realised soul who knows the job, you see – She knows, because She understands everything. So the information goes through your fingers because these fingers are actually sleeping centres, the manifestation, the gross manifestation of these centres. So the information goes down to Her there, and then She rises just like a primule or the sprouting in a seed. She rises as you put a seed in the Mother Earth the seed knows, and the seed starts sprouting. In the same way She sprouts and this germinating power, first time. Now this one, as I am going to tell you all about it tomorrow very much clearly, but may be one thread out of it might be able to pierce through because if there is problem in the centres, if there's physical, emotional, mental, any problem then the centres are constricted, then She just goes gradually and awakens one centre after another, expands it, and She makes this bone become soft, just like a child. \n",

I will not go into the details of it, but there is a big science about that: why we, our attention is outside all the time. Now below the Kundalini, which is three-and-a-half coils, is placed a very important centre of innocence, is the centre of innocence. The first thing that was emitted out of the all-pervading Power was, it had the form, I should say the all-pervading Power was nothing but just innocence, which is the most powerful thing in this world, is your innocence. And this innocence is placed below the Kundalini, and is adorned by the deity called as Shri Ganesha, who has a trunk like an elephant. This is the bija; this is the seed of Christ. This forms the seed, and then He incarnated on this Earth, this is the subtle form, on this Earth as Mahavishnu – is written down in the Devi Purana – or we call Him as Christ.

That's why this is a very important centre, is the beginning. Because it is innocence, is like a lotus and it is placed at a point where the gate to hell are open within us. This centre gives rise in the gross… Now this is a subtle centre called as Mooladhara chakra. Chakra Mooladhara. Mooladhara means the support of the root. Now root is the Kundalini. It is the support of the root. Kundalini is the Mother, and this is your innocence, this is your childhood and that's the Mother. And the Mother is there to give you your Realisation, waiting all the time, She is your own individual Mother, and She is just waiting, ages together, to give you the experience of Self-Realisation, to give you your second birth. \n",

      "Like even this camera, you see, a television, anything, this has to be put to the mains. You cannot start with your finger the camera working, can you? The electricity has to be there, in the same way energy of Kundalini has to be there to work it out. This is absurd. So the Kriya Yoga, which is described by Shri Krishna, is the living process. He said, ‘Is the living tree.’ I'm surprised. We can… human beings are very great, I must say, the way they make, make a pai out of everyone. So all these great incarnations came on this Earth; they wrote it very clearly; they said everything very clearly; it was very simple; there was nothing to be so much deluded – of course He used a word like ananya. You see in any dictionary what is the meaning of word ananya is, mean is ‘when is there is not the other.’ What have we made of Christ, what have we made of Krishna, what have we made of Rama? When I see this I'm amazed. But you can't make anything out of Me, because you will get your Realisation. After that, if you try to do anything to Me, you’ll lose your vibrations, straightforward. I can tell you this much. \n",

      "At the time when Christ came on this Earth with this big message that somebody has to pass through this special problem. Now let’s see why the problem was there. We have to understand the problem that faced human beings at that subtle level where they had to work out this special, a very extraordinary incarnation. The problem was that human beings had raised their heads. By raising their heads their ego and superego grew up around their limbic area, making it a very hard shell, just like an egg. A man developed his ‘I’-ness and only way to transform him into a bird, like an egg breaks up into a bird, was to make the Kundalini rise. \n",

      "But how to make that compact stuff where it is crossing, crossable, which can be crossed over, which can be passed through. So they had to create this special incarnation, which is nothing but Pranava, the Aum, the Logos as you call it, the sound of the all-pervading Power. To be put at a place where nothing but the power itself can remain, because anybody else, all other incarnations who came on this Earth had all the five elements within them. But He was just the power, the energy, the complete energy. He didn’t have, for example we all human beings are made of five elements on the right hand side as I told you, and when we die the part that is our body, means one of the five koshas, as they call the cocoons of the body which is the matter, falls off. Then the water cocoon also falls off and the soul remains with the Spirit on your head and the Kundalini also there. But He was the only one who had no earth element in it. And so it was a very special type of an energy engulfed, engulfed into a human being was placed. \n",

      "Happiness and unhappiness are the two coins of one coin – Should say two sides of one coin. When your ego is pampered you feel happy and when it is punctured you feel unhappy. But joy is singular, where you witness the whole World and you see everything as a beautiful creation of God. And your attention is so powerful that you can solve so many problems of the World. You reach another state, which we call as doubtless awareness, where you get all the powers to raise the kundalini of others − give them their self-knowledge. You can cure others; you can create peace on this Earth. Because you become innately righteous. I don’t have to tell you; don’t do this, don’t do that. It’s like this, if I have a snake in my hand and I am very adamant; if you tell me there is a snake, I won’t believe, I’ll say it’s a rope. Because, because there is darkness, I can’t see. [repeats for translator] And I am adamant, I don’t want to believe till the snake bites me, I don’t believe. But as soon as there is some light, I myself throwaway the snake. All that is destructive in me, I give up. Nobody has to tell me. Such a state of righteousness, you have within yourself, which is manifested. And then you come to know that all the religions were born as beautiful flowers on the same tree of spirituality. We pluck the flowers and we are fighting with the dead flowers. Thus, you transcend all these limitations of racialism, of communalism, of all kinds of nonsense that we have been adhering to. All this is your own.\n",

      "The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Not have to think about any individual but just to forgive everyone in general. Because whether you forgive or don’t forgive you are not doing anything. But it is again another myth and you are carrying on with it. Thus, you play into the hands of very wrong people and torture yourself unnecessary. But it has much deeper significance. The centre of Agnya as I showed you, is all completely blocked if you do not forgive, and the Kundalini wouldn’t rise through this constricted centre. But if you forgive it will open out. So now we have to understand that there are two powers within us, one is the power of desire and another one is the power of action. So, we have to put our left hand towards me and put both the feet apart from each other, touching the mother earth. Those who are sitting on the ground are alright. There is room they can sit if they like there is room. Alright. \n",

      " Of course it is medical terminology.

So this is to be understood that in every religion where the prophets came in, where the incarnations came in, wherever they try to show the path, they talked about Self-Realisation. All of them, of course according to time they talked, this much, that much, and all that, but today the time is of Kundalini awakening which you all should get. All right, so just remove your shoes and just put your feet on the Mother Earth. Keep both the feet apart from each other because as I told you these are two different energies within us. \n",

      "In Hindu religion, for ages people have made arrangements primarily for Kundalini awakening. But we saw it in the most beautiful form in the incarnation of Shri Krishna. The rationale behind the antics of Krishna such as stealing of butter and tying people up around himself was that if they were all tied to his Nabhi chakra, their Nabhis will also be cleared. The purpose behind Radha Ji going into river Yamuna and filling water was to vibrate the water of Yamuna river. When She carried the earthen water pitcher on Her head, Shri Krishna would break it by throwing a stone at it, the water would again trickle down Her back through Her Kundalini, getting double vibrated and ultimately falling on the land and vibrating the entire earth. So much calculation and planning was done. Only Radha Ji could do it, no one else was capable of doing it. Gopis [playmates and devotees of Krishna] going to the ‘panghat’ [waterway] has a lot of significance for us. During the incarnation of Krishna, gopis used to do many other chores, but getting water from ‘panghat’ was considered very special. Its symbolic significance was that Radha Ji used to sit with Her feet in the river and the water used to get vibrated. The gopis used to fill their pitchers with this water and take it home and this cleared their Nabhi chakra. Ras Leela is also nothing but Sahaja Yoga. You have seen that many times I tell you to sit whilst holding each other’s hands. This is not a mechanical thing; in Sahaja Yoga, many people turn mechanical. They start doing things mechanically. It is not at all a mechanical thing. Every action has to be understood carefully and you should know the meaning of every action and which chakra is getting relief due to that.\n",

      "You move in this world thinking you are very intelligent. Only once if Shri Ganesha moves His trunk, all your thievery is turned around and you land yourself in hell. You can’t show your cleverness in front of God. Once, you lie to me, I may forgive you because I am The Mother, but, Shri Ganesha is very wise. Though he is like a little child. Eternal childhood, He is the symbol of eternal childhood. This means that, when you think of your ascent when you think of God, you should be childlike, especially regarding sex. The entire reason behind the symbol of Shri Ganesha being present at pelvic plexus is to prove that there is no connection between the Divine and sex. Those who try to teach you all these nonsensical things. Please don’t be wooed by them. They are all demons. Sixteen demons have taken birth on this earth and roaming around posing to be the great Spiritual Gurus. They are all behind money. They have their issues in which they are going to be strangled themselves, but they want to play their last card and watch how many fools get caught by them. There is no connection, no connection between sex and God. To prove this Shri Ganesha is sitting there, to protect His Mother, who is sitting in Her house, which is the triangular bone inside human beings. He is sitting in front of that house. And that house belongs to your Mother too. Your Mother is called Kundalini, who is another form of Shri Gauri.\n",

      "The person who worships Shri Ganesha, knows that the Mother’s place is at a very high level and is nowhere connected with sex. An Indian understands this very well. And the person who does anything against this, he is troubled so badly by Shri Ganesha that when such a person’s kundalini rises, everyone gets burnt. No, kundalini does not rise, Kundalini is not foolish to rise but the heat that Shri Ganesha produces. It burns everything. The man starts jumping like a frog, starts shouting, removes his clothes. All these signs come from disgusting kind of people. They are ghosts themselves. They have come on this earth and are spreading sinful negativity. What is Sin, is Sin and what is Dharma is Dharma. Both cannot be mixed. Converting dharma [righteousness] into adharma [wrongdoings], converting what is holy into sins, this is what they are doing. And they are becoming successful in this cause you people are supporting as your weaknesses are being taken care of. If there is sex in the name of God then what else you need? Very good. Taking drugs in the name of God, very nice. This kind of confusion, is what Kali Yuga is all about.\n",

      "So to go back to the knowledge of the roots, we must know there is a force called Kundalini within us which can be awakened, which is the mother of every individual; an individual mother. If this has to happen, it’s a living force. Anything living, you cannot expedite it, you cannot force it. Like you want to sew a seed, you have to put it in the Mother Earth who has the capacity to awaken it. You have the seeds of seeking within you from ancient times and these seeds are to be sprouted. That’s why one must understand that it is a living process which has to take place and it has to be spontaneous, ‘sahaj’. So the Kundalini is awakened spontaneously.\n",

      "Now the other kind of people is that which makes money in the name of God. They don't understand how Shri Mataji raises the Kundalini without taking any money. But a living process does not understand money. How much money do you give to grow flowers and trees? Just as this earth does not understand money, I too don't understand money. All that money is just like dirt to Me. The Kundalini does not understand money. If you show Her money, is She going to rise? The one to whom you say 'Ude ude ambe' (Rise, rise o Mother!), is She going to rise with the help of money? But this practice of giving money has become natural for us. In every temple of the Devi, you can see how people are making money in strange ways. That is a very bad thing and they will incur a great sin because of it. Even inside a temple, they put bhoots in the bodies of women and make them dance and shout. But we are so innocent that we think, 'Oh, Devi has come into her' and rush to apply kumkum on her. You should not even touch such people! If such a woman comes in your house from one door, then Lakshmi will leave from another door. Lakshmi won't stay there. Such a tremendous sin it is to make bhoots dance in the Devi's temple! During Navaratri, to make bhoots dance, is such an enormous sin! The sin is so tremendous that even seven generations of such a person cannot nullify its effects! But these people are going on with it in every temple and others have to bear the problems of these people.\n",

      "That's why they crucified Christ or gave poison to Mohammed Sahib, did all kinds of things all over the world. With Sahaja Yoga, this mechanism is activated where you have got this Kundalini, the power, that manifests your Self-Realisation. She's a power. I call it ‘she’ because it's the Mother's power; it is your mother, she gives you birth so she's your mother and she's your individual mother. She takes all problems upon herself. Every time I've been giving lectures, people ask, ‘But we have read in such and such book that Kundalini rising gives troubles.’ I just don't know. Either they're negative people who are trying to keep you away from reality, or maybe they don't know what Kundalini is. She is your mother, waiting all these days within yourself, this power, in three and a half coils because it's some mathematics about it. And she is activated, then she rises just like a primule in a seed. As soon as you put the seed in the Mother Earth and nourish it with little water, in the same way, with little love – the divine love – she’s activated and she starts rising.\n",

Now what is the happening? The happening is that within you resides this power known as Kundalini. When I tell about Kundalini also I have to warn you because so many people I’ve seen have written some big books of Kundalini – all absurd, fake, false, useless – that you start getting heat, you start burning yourself. All nonsense, it’s not true. Kundalini is your Holy Mother. She’s there waiting for you. You have forgotten the meaning of the word holiness and the meaning of the word auspiciousness. I don’t know what has gripped you people. This is your Holy Mother and that is the desire, the holy desire, the power of desire within every human being to become one with the Divine. It’s that power within all of us that resides and that’s why you seek. That desire is not yet manifested and if it has not manifested it is sleeping, that’s all. Like we can say the power of germination in a seed is sleeping because it has not manifested. In the same way this power of desire to become one with reality, one with Divine power is still sleeping and it is to be awakened. I’ve seen in living things like a seed – you cannot pull out its primule and say that I have given it germination. You cannot. It has to be put in the Mother Earth. If you put it in the Mother Earth then only it sprouts by itself because it feels the Mother. \n",

Put your left towards Me and right hand on your heart, on the left hand side, and ask a question, ‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ In your heart you ask the question.

      "So, as it is, this Kundalini is placed within us. Now, about Kundalini, a long time back the search for Kundalini started, thousands of years back. The history is that in the beginning there were three types of people who started searching in different areas. The first ones were the ones who started searching in the nature – what is the secret of the nature. The Vedas are written on that. Vedas are the right-side movement of people where they tried to discover what are the different deities ruling the elements. You can see the great manifestation of that knowledge. In Greece, even now, you can go and see their history and when I asked them from where did they get these ideas, they told Me that there was an Indo-Arian rapport at that time – not at the time of Alexander but much earlier when they came on this Earth. It must have been thousands of years back the way the whole thing is described and they came on this part of the Earth, meaning Greece, and told them that there are these three powers and that there are three deities and the three mothers who worked it out. Imagine at that time. And they have one goddess called as Athena. \n",

For example, supposing this is the instrument [points to the microphone] or you see there is any instrument which is not yet connected to the mains. By turning this, by talking on it, pushing this, dismantling this or adding to it, will it work? On the contrary I’ll spoil it. Like a car which is not yet started. Just by moving the wheels, by moving the small little parts of it, will it work? No technique is there before realisation. Realization is a mystery, you can say. Like dropping of a seed is a mystery. You cannot say how it works. It works, doesn’t it? In the same way the awakening of your Kundalini works. Then you get connected. How it works? Can you say the electricity is inside the plug and gets connected and it works. How? You can’t explain, why is there gravity in the Mother Earth? Can you say that? You cannot. Then once it is connected then you should know the plugs and things and you should know which you have. No technique is needed before that.

      "Now this cross you see here of the optic chiasma is placed like this and it is on top of each other that they pass and it’s so close that when your ego and superego develop as a human beings, to become realised, the Kundalini has to pass through that cross which is absolutely tight. And they had to create a special deity which could go through it and that is why He came on this Earth and He died and He went through it to create that passage for us. So He said that I am the gate, and the Kingdom of God is beyond that, is the limbic area within us. This was His message and that’s how He came on this Earth. When He passes through that, through His power of forgiveness, He sucks in the ego and superego. Thus He makes us completely relaxed, we become thoughtlessly aware and the whole thing comes down like that and there’s an opening created by His awakening. So it was said that He is to be born again. That means the Kundalini must be awakened, that He should be awakened there so that He sucks in. I mean, He’s the actualization, it’s a happening, it’s a living happening of living God, so that it is sucked in. Once it is sucked in then the Kundalini rises above this and you get your realisation. \n",

      "But that’s not important. What you have to do is just get out. So you have to be in meditation. You cannot do it. It’s a living process. Those people who say that you meditate, they can only cure by going to the left or the right by which you might get possessed. You might start jumping in your feet, you might get some troubles. That’s what will happen. Actually you feel it on top of your head. Just it is a happening, it’s a cool breeze coming out of your head. Even the pulsation of the Kundalini in some people you can feel. You can see the pulsation and the rising. If you have a stethoscope, you can feel the rising of the Kundalini. There’s a cool breeze starts coming out from here because Kundalini is part and parcel of the whole. Of that whole you can feel the pulsating power and you start feeling that Ruh on top of your head and you start feeling it around your fingers. This you cannot do. You can jump, you can dress up, you can change your dresses and move about, you can shave your heads, you can cut your tongues, cut your nose and do what you like, but you cannot make your Kundalini rise. That’s the living process, like a seed sprouting. You cannot take out the primule from the seed, just pull it out, ‘Come along, come along. Now I am meditating standing on my head.’ As soon as you put it to the Mother Earth it works. It’s built in. It’s there. It’s all done. Only thing is at the time when all these great incarnations came they could not talk about it. I was surprised to read the Bible of Levi that somebody was going to come and tell you all the multiple things about [unclear everything I do for you]. It’s very clearly said by him. It’s prophesied. \n",

      "So, this Kundalini is the power within us. What power is this? This is the power of primordial desire within us to be one with the Divine, to be united with the Divine and this is the Yoga. All the rest of it is not. As you are, you are to be connected with the Divine, is the Yoga. If that is so, this desire is not yet manifested. So, it is called as a sleeping Kundalini and only the person who has that warmth of the Mother Earth can do it, as simple as that. Everyone who thinks that Kundalini is to be awakened must know it is a spontaneous, living happening, just like a sprouting of a seed. You cannot just pull it out. It cannot be done by any effort. It’s spontaneous. If it is evolutionary, logically we can find out that we did nothing to become human beings from amoeba stage. We didn’t cut our tails to become human beings, did we? We didn’t do anything. It has happened so spontaneously. But where is the change in us, let’s see again logically. Not rationally, but logically. Rationality could be quite mad. Logically you should understand, what is the difference we have got is in our awareness. Something has to happen in awareness, not in a way that you just start jumping or taking out your clothes and doing nonsensical things. It’s very easy. In the bathroom everybody does it. What’s so great? But just understand. You can see with your naked eye the pulsation of the Kundalini. If you are a first class instrument, it just happens. Like a jet it goes. It’s a jet Kundalini in the jet age. It has to happen to all of you. \n",

I am wrathful, very angry with them, because they are devils, satanic. If they wanted money, they could have smuggled. They could have done something like that, but they should not have ruined your Kundalini. They had no business to do it. They will go to hell, no doubt, but they’ll be carrying so many with them, they know that. They are trying to overpower. They are Anti-Christ. They think they can win over God. Let them know that God’s Powers are so powerful that they can all be destroyed like this in one stroke. The only thing why they are not destroyed is because today they are in your brains.

      "All this mechanism that is shown here can be related to the medical terminology of sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. Now the awakening of the Kundalini is a spontaneous happening. As a seed, when you plant it in the Mother Earth, the Mother Earth itself sprouts the seed spontaneously. In the same way, the Kundalini rises and gives you that power by which you become collectively conscious. You can know about yourself and you can know about others. First of all, your health improves; your diseases disappear. Sahaja Yoga had cured one person suffering from AIDS, and he was quite all right for a year or so, but again he went back to his bad habits and did not take to Sahaja Yoga and again he is sick. After all, the Creator has created us with such care and love. And there must be some purpose behind it. He doesn’t want us to just end up as sex points or some sensational nonsense. So He, we should say that the Divine Itself, is anxious that you all should get your realisation because you have been seekers of ages.\n",

And then you yourself start taking to right type of life. So before Realization you don't have to worry so much about disciplining. We'll say like this that there are seeds, which are sowed. And that time the gardener has to look after it. And then, there is sprouted because it is built in the seed to sprout. In the same way though the gardener just sowed the seeds, the mother earth does the job automatically. But afterwards the gardener has to look after. In the same way, you have to look after, afterwards. And in the light of your enlightenment you can do very well.\n",

And that book is now ready as called as the St. Thomas’s gospel after forty-eight years of research. Which talks of this happening and also, he talks of the centres. In all other scriptures, Indian scriptures also, it is mentioned in a very elaborate manner that there this the power of Kundalini in the sacrum bone. So, the Greeks knew about this Kundalini. She is your individual mother. And She knows all about your problems. But as your mother took all the pains of you on herself while giving you your second birth, She does all the job very beautifully. Every human being has a right to get this union − this Yoga – with the divine Power. But I do not know how many are really destined for it in this lifetime. It’s very surprising that people do not understand that it’s a living process and you cannot pay for it. They run after false things. Because they think they can purchase false gurus or false religions. God doesn’t understand money. Look at this Mother Earth. She gives us so many things. How much do we pay Her? She doesn’t understand money or banking. You can pay for the hall, you can pay for the travel, but you cannot pay for something that is living process. \n",

But if you see the fundamentals of western life is that to see and to be seen. Because perhaps may be we never worship Christ but we worship this horrible fellow Freud and kick Christ. But when the Kundalini rises, your eyes get back your innocence absolutely. All the lust and greed is finished from the eyes. And when they develop properly, even a glance of such person can bring peace, joy and joy. All this madness of wasting our attention and making our head full of tensions just disappears. And such a joyful life, such a pure life. In Sahaja Yoga we have many marriages and I have seen they get children who are born realised. Great children they get.

I have come on this Earth to prove if God is there or not. Certainly to prove it. Divine cool breeze will flow from your hands. You will receive God on your fingertips. But the preparation is needed. This mind always fools. You have to listen with cool mind whatever I say, then it will work out. If your problems would have resolved by your mental level then there was no need for me to work so hard for you all. They are not going to get resolved by your mind. Neither your family problems, political problems or social problems will get solved by your mind. Political problems are like, “we are capitalists” and we fight for it. Are they happy? Can they control their freedom? Others say that we are communist, but we are true capitalists because we have all the powers. \n",

Everyone has an individual mother like a recorded, or we can like a tape recorder, everything is recorded within us and kept intact for this last breakthrough, which we call as the second birth. About the second birth we know that everybody has talked about it. It’s not only in the Indian scriptures that they call a realised soul as the dvija, meaning born second time or twice-born; they also call a bird dvija, meaning it is first an egg and then it breaks when it is matured and a bird which is a transformed thing, which is absolutely different, absolutely free is born out of that, and this is what is really the thing where we say is a twice-born. \n",

We've got a crust of materialism, Americanism, we've got a crust of all sorts of social nonsense on top, we've been hurted quite often some of the worst aspects from Britain − whatever it might be, underneath there is the essential innocence of Australia which is there to maintain the strength of this great tree of humankind that has to grow.

      "Now I will tell you something about Kundalini, which I have… [Shri Mataji and a Sahaja Yogi speak in Marathi.] I am here for around five days more. In five days, I will tell you everything about Kundalini. From tomorrow you bring paper and pencil so that you can note the things I am telling. First, you can see in your front this, the God Almighty has created an instrument inside us. Now this instrument is not dead like other things in the world but it is live instrument. And what you call as surati is only the Kundalini. After all, we the human beings are moving on the support of something. Look at this eye – so it is such a wonderful thing. Movement of the entire body is so efficient and beautiful. Creation of the entire Earth has been done with such beauty. \n",

      "As I said, the three powers are Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna, and in the back, we have what we have gained so far as human beings – is the central nervous Sushumna system. The reason these four powers start flowing in us just like a pyramid as you see, which has three sides, which has an apex. It has one top, which Kabir has called shoonya shikhar. Kundalini passes through it and sits in the triangular bone. When a human dies, this same Kundalini circulates on top of his head. It exits from the top of the head and it guides him. And the Spirit is also with it. That Kundalini, that Spirit, and all our four elements, out of which the water element slowly reduces, Earth element reduces, and in this way, the living being gets ready to go to the mrityu lok [death place]. And this freedom that God has given us and how we use it is pretty evident. We use it in a strange way. When the ego and superego are in balance and when you are dharmic in your void, then we don’t even know when Kundalini rises. And the man gets to awakening in a moment. In a moment. And he doesn’t even know that he is awakened. Just like I told you today that when you travel in a very smooth aeroplane, you don’t even know that you are in a plane. They are very fine planes, you don’t even feel you are travelling in them. But when you do not use your freedom wisely, first you understand how we do not use our left channel freedom properly. \n",

      "This Kundalini is like a seed planted by God inside us, and I will explain in brief about it today because realisation and Kundalini awakening are important. But as I am speaking, your Kundalini will rise so keep your hands towards Me like this while I'm talking. Now, this Kundalini will rise, which resides in you. Please remove your shoes because Earthing has to happen with Mother Earth. Remove your socks also. It is good you should touch the ground. This event will happen instantly but the preparations have to be done. Sit comfortably and give some time. Don't make noise, sit quietly, please sit quietly. This is Kundalini and it resides in you like a sprout in your triangular bone. God has planted it in you. A lot can be told about it, but I will just say this that she is your mother who has lived with you in all your previous births. Whatever you have done so far she knows about it. It is recorded within her, you cannot deceive her. She keeps a note of your earnings, mistakes, your qualities, your good deeds, and your shortcomings, in this triangular bone. She is very pious and your mother. \n",

      "They have told you that it is called as Kundalini. Of course they have played havoc with it, you know that. They have really made a mess of what is called Kundalini. They have ruined it, completely ruined and that’s how they have ruined your inner being. It is shocking, really shocking. And in your frantic search you also believed these horrible people who are just out to ruin you. These people have no relationship with reality, they don’t know who is Christ, they don’t know who is Mohammed, they don’t know who is Nanak. They don’t know anything about the great incarnations who came on this Earth. They don’t want to talk about it. There is no relationship, there is no historical background to what they are saying. After all, if there is a tree and everything within comes in a circle, this has a history: it was a seed first, then it grew up to big tree, and even a seed has its history, that it was a seed and then a flower. So when these people just start talking to you offhand without any relationship to the historical background or to their, you can say, to the surrounding, they are just – in English language you can say they are talking nothing. But why do we believe it? Because they have something in them for which they control us. \n",

      "This Kundalini is the one kept in a sleeping condition, they say, for this last culmination of your evolution as a human being to become connected with that subtle force. And this Kundalini, when it rises and passes through the various chakras, it enlightens them one by one. All these chakras are placed within us during the different evolutionary periods. The first one ,which is the Ganesha Chakra as they call it, is the Mooladhara Chakra, is the centre of Mooladhara. But is not the Mooladhara or the Kumbha as they call; it is Mooladhara Chakra is the one that sustains the Mooladhara. Now what is the word meaning Mooladhara, means the support of the root. What is the support of the root? The support of the root is the ground, is the Earth, is the matter, and that's why this represents the matter within us. Matter is innocent, matter has got innocence, and you get your innocence from this chakra. Shri Ganesha was made out of the, they say – it is a beautiful poetic way of saying it – out of the mud that was covering the Mother Parvati, or you can say the Gauri, at that time. Because She was not married in the sense that She was a virgin, just finished Her marriage, and She was to meet Her husband. And this virgin wanted to have a bath before meeting Her husband, so She cleanses Her hands properly and makes this deity of Shri Ganesha, which is bestowed on this centre. If you really develop your proper insight through meditation, you can see Shri Ganesha settled down there very clearly. \n",

      "Shri Ganesha is the embodiment of innocence, and that's why He is a child, that's why His head is that of an elephant, because an elephant, being an animal, doesn't grow into ego and superego like human beings do. That’s why He is a child. He is the embodiment of childhood and He incarnated on this Earth once, which is described in Devi Bhagwhat, if you read, as Mahavishnu. He has incarnated as Mahavishnu, and this was nobody else but Lord Jesus Christ. Even He was born in a way, the same way as Ganesha was born: without the father, to a virgin. If I am saying something untrue you can find out later by verifying it through a method which I will explain to you a little later. This is a very, very important centre for all of us, because unless and until the Deity settled on this chakra permits, the Kundalini will not rise. If your innocence is in danger, the Kundalini will never rise, and even if it rises for a little while out of its excitement, it will again be sucked back. Though this chakra is placed below the Kundalini, which is a very important point, which people do not know. It is below the Kundalini and not above the Kundalini, so it is not necessary to pierce this Kundalini, pierce this chakra through the Kundalini, it is not necessary. What is necessary is to know the importance of this centre and allow the Kundalini to rise and it passes through other six chakras and that is why is known as [unclear]. And that means there are six chakras which it crosses. \n",

      "Everybody has to be seated. If there are one or two chairs, if you can bring in, all the people should be seated. Now the first condition, as I told you, you are not to feel guilty. Now, the second condition is, as you forgive yourself, you have to forgive others. You might say it is difficult, but logically it is not. Logically, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But, but when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself, and at this moment if you don't forgive, the centre here of optic chiasma is like this, absolutely, like this. It is constricted, so when you forgive it opens like this, and then only this Kundalini can pass through. So don't say it is difficult, it's very easy. Just say, 'I forgive everyone,' and don't even think about them, that's a headache. Now third condition is very simple, that you have to take out your shoes. In England when I told them first time, half of them wanted to leave. The English are attached to their shoes. Now please put both your feet on the ground, parallel.

      "It is not a mental thing, but it’s a happening and it is also becoming. And that becoming, if it takes place, then you all have the power to raise the Kundalini, to cure the people, to do so many things that I think I cannot describe in this short lecture. Those people who have now ascended have solved all their problems. We have three doctors in India who have got M.D. showing how some of the incurable diseases are cured by them. Sahaja Yoga definitely can cure cancer and many other diseases which cannot be cured. You’ll know on your fingertips all the problems that you have in your centres. All the world's problems are because of human beings, and all the human problems are because of these centres. If you can know, if you can find out how to cure these centres, you have solved your problem and you can solve the problem of others. Sometimes it acts very fast. I’ve seen people getting rid of their drugs and other habits overnight, overnight. And for all this we don’t have to pay. You can’t pay for it. God doesn’t send money to Swiss Bank. He doesn’t know banks. You don’t have to pay for it because it is a living process. How much do we pay to Mother Earth for creating these flowers? It is built in, in Her nature, built in in the seeds that you get the results. Why have all the religions have failed? Because they became money--oriented or power--oriented. They were never, never spirit--oriented. With this kind of an approach, how can you reach the state of Spirit? You may have money, you may mint money, you may counterfeit money, but you cannot counterfeit the Spirit.\n",

And then this Buddha came in, but Zen was the same of Buddha thought of it. Very close to that. Then we had in China Tao. Tao means actually Kundalini. And it compared the Kundalini with the Yangtze river. I mentioned to my husband that ever, because he was shipping there and said that this is the most difficult river which one has to cross.

I have told you all this just now that there is nothing, they will never mention that is sensible, but it's not so. I would say Sikhism, we can say is the latest religion. I mean there are so many verses about, much later than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth and they have said that, complete description, I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise I would have told you − Ida, Pingala, Sushumna − everything they have described − Kabira has described at such length that we have in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has described all about Kundalini.

Everything that is living is spontaneous and should happen to all of you, no doubt about it. You don't have to do anything as I said but you have to receive the power within yourself, to invite the Kundalini to rise. Now first thing I have to request, I hope it is not too much of it, that we have to take out our shoes to touch the Mother Earth. Is very important because the Mother Earth is the one which sucks in, for a while. I don't know, is there a carpet there?

And sit, not crossed-legged but putting both the feet with respect, towards the Mother Earth, in parallel to each other. Now maybe some of you must have started feeling the cool breeze, I don't know, might have, because today's lecture was rather too terrific and William Blake must have worked it out I'm sure. But otherwise is very simple. Now we have to do is to ourselves awaken our own Kundalini, which is very simple, which I will tell you. In the heart resides the spirit, so first we'll have to put our hand to our heart. I will tell you one by one. And then in the upper part of your stomach where the Guru Tattwa is here, the principle of guru is there. Then in the lower part of the abdomen, where it is the Divine, or we can say the pure knowledge that exists and which works. This is the centre through which the pure knowledge, the pure technique, works. \n",

      "Here the sea has taken refuge in the Mother. The guru has bound itself with the motherly qualities. A person feels more safe on the ground than on the sea or in the air. So today is the best opportunity for Me to say that after the Guru Puja, we have to understand that to be holy means you must allow the guru tattwa to circulate in the Mother principle. Or the guru tattwa is to be controlled and guided and beautified by the Mother principle. It's only the Mother Earth that is beautiful because it can create so many varieties, so many dramas, so many places. Any other element, if you see, has nothing in it. So it is She who can create. So we should take to the motherly quality more and try to bind our guru principle through that Motherly, beautiful, creative power, so that we make our presence very agreeable, very congenial, very beautiful, full of interest and varieties; every time new flowers, every time new fruits, every time a new, new design. As Kundalini is made of Mother Earth, we are quite capable of doing that.\n",

      "There are gurus and gurus and gurus but no one so far is such a master as you are of the Kundalini. If they were they would have given Realisation to thousands. Why? Because your Mother has penetrated into your guru principle. And has risen your Kundalini, has given you powers to raise Kundalini, breaking your seventh chakra, so clearly. That never happened with anyone. Even incarnations could not do that to the masses, as you are doing. Kundalini is flowing from your hand; the Ganesha is active in you, but it should never give you the ego, or the sternness or the heaviness of the sea. But it should give you the beauty of the Mother Earth. Mother Earth is always bigger than the sea, because She has to contain the sea.\n",

      "Sea can never be bigger than the Mother Earth. Sometimes it looks, sea, bigger but sea is contained in the Mother Earth. It cannot go beyond. So Mother Earth is always greater, bigger, wider than the sea. So one has to understand that when Kundalini has risen, you have become all of the seven chakras and not only the guru chakra. And when you have become the guru chakra it is also bounded on all sides by the Mother Earth. Under these circumstances, when we are so capable, we are giving Realisation to so many people, when we are achieving so many things, if we could just become humble, congenial, beautiful, we can master the whole world. But I find in the styles of Sahaja Yogis, especially in the west, and westernized Indians, there is so much of ego still expressed in their talks, in their behaviour. They are not capable of it, to see I think sometimes, but better see it. First you may have to act as sweet people, maybe, but you must learn that way.\n",

If you notice it, the one thing about the Mother Earth's beauty that She creates and how sweetly She does it, you will say that even one billionth of that, if we have, we could be somewhere, already, ruling, in the Kingdom of heaven, this is what it is. So as you have got your Kundalini, you must develop that sweetness in you, in such a manner that people see you and think that you are great mothers. But as you know in the west the mothers are so horrible, the women are so dominating, that people do not have a proper image of a mother also. Women are extremely dominating. Women must learn to dominate, it's so easy. A bull can dominate anybody, but can they be like Mother Earth, which can bear up all kinds of troubles, all kinds of problems. Can we do that way? Especially that's why I request women of this country to develop those beautiful qualities and not of domination. Domination, it doesn't behove a woman, it doesn't look nice on her.\n",

So those people who go on asking for money, there're many we had, false people who came from my country and from other countries, making money, minting money, teaching dirty things, there's nothing to be taught. You have to have the experience, experience of your Spirit and experience of this Divine Power. Once you have this experience then you'll be surprised to know that how all your problems get solved. First you become in a state which we call as the peaceful state because the thoughts on which we jump are coming from the future or the past but nothing from the present. When the Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts and we are placed in the state of present which is reality and no thought. It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi in Sanskrit language.\n",

So, it is clear now, that when you get your Self-Realisation, this centre does not come into play. So, one of the activity of this centre, is a sex activity. So those people who say, that through sex you can achieve God, they are all nonsensical. Of course, the sex is important and is also transitory, but we are not sex points, we are human beings, and we have to become superhuman beings. So, there is no prohibition on sex or anything but what is important is, that our attention should be for achieving the eternal. In Sahaja Yoga we have many marriages. This time we had about 75 marriages and most of them are very successful and we get very beautiful children out of these marriages. So, what happens is that this Kundalini just like a primula in a seed sprouts with the living process. As the seed germinates, when we put it in the Mother Earth, this Kundalini also starts rising because the Mother Earth has got capacity.\n",

In Sahaja Yoga, you awaken your Kundalini to the living process and you awaken that in yourself, the religion in yourself, which gives you balance and which is innate. It is the combination of all the religions. Because all these great prophets and the incarnations came on this Earth to create this tree of life as you see here. Christ has said, ‘Those who are not against Me are with Me’; who are ‘those’? So, we put blinkers on both the sides on our heads, on our brains, and we don’t want to see anything around like horses. For example, who was Christ? What was His innate nature? What was His principle? How He was created? And why He incarnated? All these will describe in one of the great books in India called as Devi Mahatmya. So, He described as Mahavishnu. But nobody wants to read anything about His life before His advent. \n",

And those who are sitting on the chairs please take out your shoes to take the help of the Mother Earth. And the sky is there to help us also. You have to be very comfortable, and you have to sit straight, not bending too much, not slouching, not stretching yourself. Now, put your left hand towards Me. And I will tell you what is to be done with the right hand to raise your own Kundalini. First you will have to touch your heart, where resides the Spirit. The you will have to touch your upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Then you have to put your right hand on the left-hand side in the lower portion of your abdomen. Now this is the centre, the upper one, is the centre of your mastery and the lower one is the centre of pure knowledge of the Divine’s work. Now again you have to go back on to the centre of your mastery. We are only one [unclear] on the left-hand side. \n",

      "It’s very interesting the way you’ve found out. Today is the real Guru Purnima. The Purnima is the day when the moon is full. I knew this, but for Sahaja Yogis which we have to arrange Saturday, Sunday, Monday – Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Whenever it is, whether it is on that date or not, we have to arrange it. So in that case, this time it was a day, I think two days before we arranged it, so it doesn’t matter. After all, moon is there for us and we are for moon, so it cannot be something that would have very wrong in it. I have already told you such a lot about the Guru principle. In the Guru principle, we have seen people who came on this Earth. They were all mostly all born realised actually, and they never gave realisation to anyone to – a very big difference. They were all born as realised souls and they became as Sufis and they’re called by different names, but they were not given Self-Realisation, they had it, and because of their Self-Realisation, as they had, they have so much of knowledge and that is what they try to impart to people. They knew all about Chakras – everything they knew, somehow, must be in their last lives achievements that they knew it, perhaps some of them were disciples of other very great people. I don’t know how they had full ideas to what is Self-Realisation is and what do we achieve after Self-Realisation. Now the only person, I think, Mohammad Sahib, is the one who has talked about Miraj. Miraj is the ascent through our Kundalini. \n",

It’s like you put a seed in the Mother Earth and it sprouts by itself. And your forefathers believed in the Mother Earth as the Primordial made of the Primordial Mother, She has made it. Imagine they have Kundalini depicted. How many people in the world knew about Kundalini except for Indians? But surprisingly the Colombians also, the ancient Colombians knew about Kundalini. That was their faith. They might have seen it; they might have felt it. So, you have such blessings of your forefathers. It’s going to work out, I know all of you are going to get your Self-Realisation tonight. Only thing you must have faith in yourself. You should not feel guilty about anything. You don’t have to confess anything to Me, you don’t have to change your dress or change your hair style, nothing of the kind. It is not superficial, it is within. But you must have full self-confidence in you. You must know that you are going to get it and that you have to forgive yourself. If you have committed some mistakes, finished. What’s the use of feeling guilty?\n",

But you must look after your Self-Realisation. We have some very good Sahaja Yogis here who can guide you how to meditate only for ten minutes in the evening. But you should not leave it in the middle [Shri Mataji laughs]. It would be like the parable of Christ that some seeds cast to germinated and were thrown in the marsh, you see, that’s will be something like that. If you respect yourself then this self-knowledge should grow. It’s for free, you cannot pay for Divine love. Many people don’t understand how much do we pay to this Mother Earth for this, flowers? Because this is your own, your own right to have your Self-Realisation. So, time is there, we have to have our experience of Self-Realisation.

You just see that you stop the thoughts. Even now I see some of the ladies and men have wobbly eyes. That's very wrong. You can't afford to do that in Sahaja Yoga. If it is so, try to put down your eyes because these eyes cannot allow your Kundalini to rise. You have to have innocent eyes without any lust and greed. Now I always say, all sins are forgiven, but not after realisation. They are added up, sometimes multiplied. After realisation, if you start doing all these nonsensical things again, you'll go down very fast, very, very low, so low that we won't be able to take you up again. So be careful. To think that all sins are forgiven, and we can put our attention anywhere, we can see this side, that side, watch everyone − that's not good.\n",

As you see, when you put a seed in Mother Earth, it sprouts on its own. It cannot enliven itself, but it is the Mother Earth that enlivens every part of it! Similarly, with Kundalini awakening, all your ‘vruttis’ (negative aspects) automatically disappear. This is indeed a fascinating phenomenon, yet it is not that surprising either, simply because it is it is Ghor Kali Yuga and in this very time, that you destined to gain this spirituality that places you at the highest pedestal, what is innately built inside you.

      "I bow to all the seekers of Truth. At the very outset we have to know that Truth is what it is. We cannot change it; we cannot organize it; we can conceptualize it and also unfortunately we cannot know it at our human awareness. One has to become the Spirit to know the Truth. When I am talking to you about it, I would request you to have a scientific outlook to keep your mind open and whatever I am telling you today, you have to treat it as a hypothesis and if you find that it works. We have to accept it as honest people because it is for the emancipation of the human beings and for the emancipation of the whole world. He has talked to you about the mechanism that works it out and what happens when you get your self-realisation? That is a very important point one should know. When this residual energy Kundalini called in the Triangular bone which is called as ‘Sacrum’. Sacrum means sacred which I think the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone. Its spontaneously awakened just like a primule in a seed awakens when it is embedded in the Mother Earth. It’s a spontaneous happening that is Sahaj. Sah means with, ja means born. Born with is you is this right to have the union with this all-pervading Divine Power is the right of every human being. Whatever country he lives, whatever races he may belong, whatever community religion he may be in. All of you, all human beings have a right to get united to this all-pervading power.\n",

      "The first truth about you is that: you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this ego, you are not these conditionings, but you are pure Spirit. And the second truth is that we are surrounded by the all-pervading power of Divine Love which does all the living work. Its intelligence, its efficiency. It's so great that we cannot even understand it at human level. You see the flowers that they are there, you see the trees. Your country is so beautiful. You take it for granted, you don’t even think how this Mother has produced these different trees and they have a different height. They keep to their heights. How these flowers are created? The same Mother Earth creates different types of flowers from different seeds and gives different fruits. So this living process that is going on with us also of the autonomous nervous system, we take it for granted. We do not want to think how it happens. Only the saints, and the prophets and the incarnations of ages knew about it. Because this is the knowledge of the roots. Our civilization has grown outside very much but we have not found out our roots. That’s why all kinds of problems are there even economic problems that we are facing today. We have to find out our roots first. Otherwise, how are we going to nourish this tree? That’s why it is important for everyone for themselves and for the whole world to know that they are the Spirit. When this Kundalini rises through various centres as you have seen it raises only through six centres. And it is spontaneously happening.\n",

You may give to the florist but not to the Mother Earth. She does everything. She sprouts the seeds, and she gives us beautiful fruits, beautiful flowers.

      "At this juncture, one may ask that ‘Why did She not straight forward create human beings?’ That was the idea of God Almighty, just to create human beings without telling them anything − something − better animals than the rest of the animals. But Adi Shakti, being the Mother, She had Her own way of expression that She thought, She must create the mirrors for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image, to see His character and that's how this long range of evolution took place. This evolution had to work out this way because they had to know from where they come. We must know that we come from nature. Even nature should know it comes from the mother Earth, and mother Earth herself has her own Kundalini − and she too is not just a dead Earth, but she knows, she thinks, she understands, and she regulates. You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations, how every fruit is produced in a particular tree − how it happens? What works out this kind of regulation? If this mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than what it is today, we would not have been born even. If it would have been less speed, it would not have worked out. See the whole plan that was made − it is a beautiful plan that the mother Earth has to move around the Sun in such a manner that different seasons are created, that's why the power − the Paramchaitanya − which is the power of the Adi Shakti, is also called as Ritambhara Pragnya.

      "In this little lecture, I don’t think I’ll be able to tell you all about it. Only thing I have to tell you, as in this hall there are many lights and if you have to put the lights on, you just have to tell somebody that, ‘All right, this is the switch, put on and it’s all done,’ because it is built in. All this is built in within you. I don’t have to do anything. It’s your own Power which will be awakened. Of course, you can’t pay for it. It is a living process like the Mother Earth. She sprouts these flowers. How much do we pay Her? We don’t pay Her anything. She doesn’t understand money, She doesn’t understand banking. She doesn’t understand even recession. That is our headache. That Mother Earth is innocent. That’s Her job is just to sprout these flowers, in the same way that Kundalini gets sprouted. There is no obligation, you cannot pay for it. For awakening you cannot pay, for the knowledge you cannot pay for it, you cannot pay for anything. Of course, you have to pay for this hall for which I’m sure some Sahaja Yogis have paid, or we have a Trustee that must have paid for this hall. But you cannot pay for a spiritual life. One has to understand this very clearly. But I don’t know how everybody has become so money-oriented that it has penetrated into also our religious groups and religious movements. It cannot be. It’s absolutely wrong. Anybody who says that he pays, you have to pay for a certain kind of emancipation or some kind of an awareness – like TM and all those nonsensical things – beware. It is absolutely nonsensical. \n",

      "Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing. In the tradition of spirituality it is mentioned about 14.000 years back by Markandeya. That ultimately it is the force within you of the Holy Ghost, which is called as Kundalini residing in the triangular bone has to give the Realisation. But for that happening human being had to be prepared. People had to be balanced. And that is how many prophets came on this earth after that in the same tradition to prepare people to have that balance. Right from Abraham, Moses we see them, follow them up, up to Raja Janaka who was the father-in-law of Rama. And later on we had so many others like Mohammed Sahib, Nanak Sahib on this earth to tell us about having a balance in live. They taught us moderation and not to go to extremes.\n",

      "Yes, yes, the mother is also your… There are many mothers we have. First is a Primordial Mother who is the will of God and she goes into three forms within us and one form of her creates this universe. Then this Mother Earth, which we call \"Mother Earth\" is one of the elements which actually represent the Kundalini, represented as Kundalini, that is why she is called as Mother Earth. Now, this Kundalini is the reflection of this Primordial Mother, the Holy Ghost, and that's why Mother Earth is also-called as \"Mother Earth\". And I must tell you that this Mother Earth understands many things, she has her own unconscious. When the man grew his ego, also she grew up Himalaya, at the same time Himalaya came up. Himalaya is the Sahasrara, it's represented as Sahasrara, it's quite complicated, this you will know later. But I'm just saying she acts as if the Kundalini acts, Mother Earth herself. But you will know all these things later on, like we can say that Italy is the pancreas of the Universe and England is the heart of the Universe and you will see why I say that, later on, you will understand all that.\n",

      "I bow to all the seekers of truth. People told me that in Venice, there are many seekers. But I did not know that there are so many, I am very happy to meet you all. Now at this time we have to know, that this is the most important time for all the seekers; because this is the time when you have to get your seeking, yourself, your Spirit. In the history of seeking, we have never had so many seekers on this earth. The reason is, this is the special time that has come, where you have to get your blessings of your age old seeking. Whatever you have heard about the Kundalini is the knowledge of the roots. The tree of the human civilization has grown too big and we must seek our roots, otherwise all this that is developed can be destroyed in no time. We have to ask ourselves a question, “Why we are created from amoeba to this stage of a human being?” The second question should be asked to ourselves, we see day the miracles of living force around us but we have never felt the existence of it. When you ask these two questions, the third question comes, to our mind, “Why are we here? What are we doing here? What are we supposed to seek? What is the truth?” \n",

      "In our search we have become human beings, but beyond that, only one little stage left where you have to become the Spirit. For this we have got from all the scriptures of ancient times, modern times, writings that we all have to get our second birth to become the Spirit. In Sanskrit language a bird is called as ‘Dwijaha’; and a brahimin is also-called a Dwijaha, means twice born. But this happening is a living happening. Of a living force, so you have to feel on your central nervous system. Whatever you have achieved in your evolution, you have felt it on your central nervous system, like a dog cannot go through, can go through, but a man cannot. So whatever has to happen to us has to happen in our central nervous system and we should be able to feel it the experience and we should be able to use it. In the ancient time, union the yoga was given to very few people. On the Tree of Life there were very few flowers, but today is the blossom time and thousands of you have to become the fruits. But you must remember that you cannot pay for it, you cannot purchase it, you cannot sell it, it’s a living process just like sprouting of the seed, where you cannot pay to the Mother Earth, for what she has done for you. This awakening of the Kundalini which is within you takes no time, whatsoever to be awakened. But problem in the modern time is that we are rather complicated people. Still it works out in no time, but you have to establish yourself. Because as soon as you feel very happy and joyous, blissful you think that now you have got everything and you do not establish it. Then again, the Kundalini goes down, she looks after different centres and you must learn how to bring it back and establish it. \n",

      "I have been talking about this since 1970. People told Me that they will kill Me. I said that there is no one on this earth who can kill Me. No-one did anything or even filed a case against Me, because I know the truth and I can tell them to their faces that they are fakes and they are taking people for a ride and cheating them of their money. These people will go to hell, along with their disciples. These people don't fight among themselves. Christ has said many times, ‘Satan will never speak against his own house.’ Everyone has a separate place, saying, ‘You run your business and let me run mine. You don't talk about me and I won’t talk about you. You are good and I am good.’ They are looting money with both hands. Not only that, they are also spoiling your Kundalini and giving you health problems. What right have they got to spoil your Kundalini or to divert you from the truth? They are cheating you, because you people are searching for God. You are seekers and very simple. And you are also getting attracted to them because they are mesmerising you. I have seen that people face trouble after trouble; their family members fall sick, they lose all their money, but still they hold on to their guru's feet. At least have some brains. But after realisation, I don't have to tell you anything. You will understand everything by yourself.\n",

      "A few things have to be done, very simple. Those who don't want to do it can go. You cannot force them. It has to be done in your own freedom and glory. And if you don't want to have it's your own choice. Nothing can be forced, this is a divine blessing which has to be asked for. As Christ has said, we have to knock – in the same way. So, it works on the principle that we are all computers and you have to ask a question to a computer like Me and then you get the answers as the Kundalini awakening – to explain it more sort of in a scientific thing. But it is a very simple method that we have to take and you have to help your centres also. As it is it works spontaneously, no doubt, but if we can little bit help our centres it expedites and later on, if you go home, you can also work it out yourself. It's a very simple thing is – I don't know how far he has told you about the channels, but the left side represents your emotional side and your desire to get realisation. And the right side is the action that you have to take. So, first of all, we have to take the help of the Mother Earth, and also the shoes sometimes block the awakening, so it's better to take out the shoes for a while, just for a short time. It will hardly take ten minutes, hardly ten minutes.\n",

      "Within us lie all this 7 centres which are the gifts of our evolution. When we were carbon atom to form the amino acids we were at the first centre that you see there. That is the centre of innocence because matter is innocence. Then we gradually grew up and came up to a point where we have reached up to our head. You can see there are 6 chakras above the first one. Above the first chakra there is the power, the fourth power which is going to give us of our realisation. It is the sleeping power within us. It is the power of pure desire. All other desires are impure because they are not satiable in general. If they were pure desire we would have been satisfied people. So this power of pure desire is the power within us which wants us to become one with the Divine. This is the power which wants to be the absolute. In our evolution we have reached this point of awareness. There is one more step to go. But all this process is a living process of a living power. It is not something dead that we can manage it. As you can put seed into the mother earth and it sprouts spontaneously, in the same way your ascent takes place. This power within you which is know as Kundalini unites you with the Divine. As a result of that you start feeling the all-pervading power of Divine all around you. You start feeling it on top of your head. A cool breeze of the holy ghost because Kundalini is the reflection of the holy ghost which is called as the Adi Shakti. In Sanskrit language meaning the primordial mother. \n",

      "Now those people who artificially try to preach and profess something reach no where. Its like this in different period of our evolution the great incarnations, the prophets came on this earth to build up those centres within us. They are like a milestones of our evolution. But from this tree life which was living they plucked out followers at different times and said ‘this is my flower, this is my flower’ for the dead flowers. And that is why we see in this world people who call themselves religious are actually forced into it. A man who calls himself a Hindu, Muslim, Christians, sikh or any religion is capable of doing any sin. He can murder any one, he can take away theft whatever it is he can do, he can torture people, he can cheat people, deceit people, tell lies, he will be tempted to do wrong things, he will be a hypocrite; but when the Kundalini rises she entitles within us our 10 valencies. Like carbon has 4 valencies, humans have 10 valencies; and when these valencies are enlightened we become automatically righteous, virtuous people. We become saints. But we don’t have to run away from this world. We don’t have to go to Himalayas and stand on our heads. Living here among people you become strong, healthy saints. \n",

Now put your right hand on your forehead across and then you have to take your hand on the back side of your head and put your head resting on it. Now stretch your hand and the centre of your palm please put in on the fontanel bone area and bend your head. Stretch your fingers out. Move it 7 times slowly your scalp. Now now we start our meditation. Actually its not meditation but awakening of Kundalini. Please take out your shoes. You have to touch the mother earth with the both the feet parallel to each other. If you have got spectacles you can put them away because your eye sight also improves. Because you will be closing your eyes. Please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.\n",

      "So, one has to realise that still that happening has to take place, only by saying that we are brothers and sisters it’s not going to happen. You should be happy to know that first time when I came to Russia, twenty-five Generals came on the way to give realisation. Such love, and such kindness and such sweetness there is just waiting for us. So, the last and the most beautiful thing about Spirit is that it is the source of joy. It is beyond the duality of happiness and unhappiness. It is pure joy. Normally those people who talk of spirituality are extremely serious people. How can they be, because Spirit is the source of joy. So, one has to sing, one has to dance to express the joy. So now I think we can have a session of Kundalini awakening with all of you sitting here and I am sure most of you will get your Self-Realisation. Tomorrow again I am going to come back. And I will explain to you many more things. But it is not the mental understanding that helps. The state is achieved beyond thought. That is the first state called as Thoughtless awareness. I must tell you that you cannot pay for it because it is a living process. Like a seed, you plant in the mother earth. You don’t pay anything to the mother earth. The quality of sprouting is built-in, in the seed, as well as the living process quality is in the mother earth. And there is no obligation for you because it is your own power. This is your own power which you receive, your own blessings and you become the Spirit. \n",

Now, raise your right hand to your heart, here you start [unclear] Now you have to ask me a very fundamental question, you can call me ‘Shri Mataji’ or you can call me ‘Mother’, ‘Mother am I the Spirit?’ ask this question three times please. If you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your master. Now take out your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here, again you ask me a question three times, ‘Mother, am I my own master?’ I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So please now, put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen in your left-hand side. And ask six times, because this centre has got six petals. ‘Mother, please give me pure knowledge.’ Six times please. As soon as you ask for your knowledge, your Kundalini starts moving upwards. So now, we have to nourish our higher centres with our self-confidence. \n",

      "Shri Vishnu’s seat is in our Nabhi chakra on this Nabhi, Shri Vishnu who is swaying on this ocean is the ocean of love. It is said that from Shri Vishnu’s navel, Brahmadeva was born [created], is true, and had to be worked out from the Nabhi. On this Nabhi the Primordial Mother [Adi Shakti] created Shri Brahmadeva, who fabricated the whole world. In this, there is no religion involved. I tell you that all the religions [dharmas] are established in our kundalini, need to integrate outwardly, all religions should be brought together, why talk unnecessary nonsense. We are integrated within ourselves. We are sublimated within ourselves. At least try to look within ourselves. When the universe was first created, the Supreme Being [Paramatma] created firstly Shri Ganesha. It has a reason, Shri Gauriji [before meeting Shiva], the one who is the Adi Shakti created Shri Ganesha, who is his mother. Those people who feel vibrations, they know the earth [Mother Earth] also emits vibrations. Gauri who is herself Adi Shakti personified, from her body created him, meaning Shri Ganesha was created with vibrations. The making of Shri Ganesha is very necessary because Shri Ganesha is an immortal universal child. Who is the incarnation of auspiciousness? Auspiciousness is his dharma [virtue], auspiciousness is his karma [action], and he lives inauspiciousness. So this Shri Ganesha who was created, in the Mooladhara at the bottom, as I have shown you, was established by his mother, Shri Gauri. Otherwise, the whole creation will be wasted if the auspiciousness is removed from this universe. Today people are madly after destroying auspiciousness. You don’t know those who call themselves modern, intellectuals, who disturb the auspiciousness, don’t know that auspiciousness is the very foundation of the human race.\n",

      "At the time of Christ, one felt it was necessary to say otherwise people won’t understand. If at that time they had recognised Christ, there would have been no problem. But still, human beings had to evolve, further. Somebody had to cross the Agnya chakra in the Virata, to go through that door. That’s why Christ came on this earth. It is most surprising, that in this Tree of Life, when the roots give out the shoot, and the shoot gives out the branches, and the branches give out the leaves, and the flowers also blossom out of the same tree, those who know the roots do not want to know the shoot, those who know the shoot do not want to recognise the flowers. This is typical human nature. I never said about Myself. Because, it was felt, that human beings have now achieved another dimension of ego. Even worse than at the time of Christ. May you blame anything, you can call it industrial revolution because you were away from nature, or whatever you may call it. But human beings had lost all contact, with reality. They were identified with artificiality, and to accept such a great reality is going to be impossible for them, that’s why I never said a word about Myself – till of course some of the saints, told about Me, some of the possessed people also told about Me; and also people started wondering, that how the most difficult thing of Kundalini awakening takes place, with that speed in the presence of Mataji. \n",

Many saints, who are away from the madding crowd, sitting in the jungles, on the Himalayas, all know about it. Because their awareness is at a point, where they understand. They understand much more than you do, because you are still children, newly born. They are grown up. \n",

The mother element of earth is there, higher, but this is the child element – that is the innocence – is placed. The embodiment of innocence is placed under the Kundalini.

      "God has created this universe. How much money did you pay to become a human being from a monkey? How much money do you pay for sowing a seed in the soil, to the Mother Earth? Do you pay any money? How much money are we going to pay for our realisation? What do you have, what is your wealth, what can you pay? It is something so invaluable you can pay anything you like; you cannot pay what you have got in your realisation. It is all God has given you. He has given you a beautiful Kundalini. He has given you your old yantra. He has given you your Spirit. Now what can you pay Him except for complete gratitude, for what He has done. Just to sing His mahima to sing His glory that’s all you can do. But just to think that you can buy Him and purchase Him and also organise Him, is another foolishness and stupidity. You have to be sensible enough. Everything should be logically understood that how can you purchase God in the market. \n",

      "Today we are going to discuss the Void: what we call Void in Sahaja Yoga is different from the way people talk of void. Void is the complete visceral cavity which is called in Sahaja Yoga language as Bhavasagara. Many a times, you must have heard people singing songs, poets singing songs saying ‘Bhavasagara se para utaru.’ What is this Bhavasagara? This is the symbol or this is the reflection of the whole entire universe that is created. All this universe is created by Brahmadeva. He is the one who is the creator, who is a ‘raksna yeta’ [unclear] of this world, who created this beautiful universe, in that especially he created the Mother Earth. He has placed the moon and the sun on both the sides of this Mother Earth and the representatives of the Mother Earth within us is the Kundalini, the Mooladhara. Now this universe exists within us, that is the Bhavasagara. This Bhavasagara exists in many stages in its evolutionary form and today it is Kali Yuga in this Bhavasagara. I would say it is the dawn of Satya Yuga and the end of Kali Yuga. And this Bhavasagara is placed in the centre – is the centre of Nabhi, Nabhi charka. And around it, moves the centre of Swadisthana. \n",

      "I hope you have understood today’s lecture. Though, I spoke in a very entertaining manner but you have to know that all this entertainment has to go within yourself, you have to take within yourself, it’s not meant for others. As soon as you say it is for other, the women will look at the husbands and the husbands will look at the wife. They do not know it is meant for you and not for others. All of you should take it up, that am I doing this, am I doing this, try to correct yourself, you have to be decent husbands and decent wives and I would like to see very happy married couples amongst Sahaja Yogis; when this will happen then the great souls will take birth on this earth, you will see great people will be born. Already so many Sahaja Yogis have given birth to very, very great souls. You will be amazed they know Kundalini from their very childhood; this will happen I am sure one day it will come, and that all the souls who want to take birth will be born on this earth, especially in India. Already lots of great souls I have seen also in England, let me go I see in Australia I am sure it’s happening everywhere. But if you are realised souls you really become perfect parents and you really invite the great souls on this earth to work it out. May God bless you. \n",

      "The last centre within us, the seventh centre within us, manifests the pelvic plexus. I don’t know if you are doctors here, but I’ll tell you the pelvic plexus, that’s the excretion within our body. All that is excreted is manifested through this subtle centre within us, which is below the sacrum bone, is a subtle centre. It looks after the prostate gland. Now this is the centre of innocence. Innocence is the first thing God has created on this earth; is holiness, is beauty of God, is love. And this innocence resides within us below the Kundalini, and in my next lecture in the same hall I will be speaking in details about it, how it manifests other aspects in our life. But why this is an important point, that it is placed lower than the Kundalini, because it says that our excretion is done by pelvic plexus which is manifested by this particular centre called as Mooladhara chakra, has nothing to do with Kundalini. \n",

As shown here which Dr. Warren has described to you, all the system exists within you absolutely, efficiently, accurately made to work out the other system by which you get urdhvagati. It’s not a cock and bull story. All those people in the ancient time talked about the Atmabodha, they were not telling lies. But in the modern times as I told you, people have talked all nonsense about Kundalini which is not true. You give your realisation to others as people say, but actually you do not give any realisation to anyone. By the nature of a personality itself you get realisation. As I told you it’s a living process and as you can sprout a seed by putting in the Mother Earth, you get automatically, spontaneously, sahaj this sprouting and the ankura comes out. In the same way, your Kundalini rises spontaneously. \n",

      "So, something has to trigger it so it breaks into away that it goes into the space where it relates itself to the all-pervading Power which is unlimited. So, in the three dimension that we are, we cannot feel that all pervading power around us. The Kundalini has to rise and give you realisation. This is the only way it has to happen. Now, it is Sahaja, means ‘born with you’. You cannot pay for it. It’s a simple thing, you cannot pay for it. I mean the other day one lady was quite shocked to hear that I don’t take money. I said, ‘how much will you pay me?’. We can’t understand how we became so money oriented; I think all in our head the money rupees has gone into our head set. We can’t think of something that is free. Whatever is vital has to be free. For example, you are breathing. If you are breathing, if you have to do by paying money, I don’t know how many will exist or by reading some books or by going to the library or going to somebody, if you have to do your breathing that way, is going to be difficult. In the same way your ascent, whatever has happened has been free it has going to be absolutely free because it is invaluable. You cannot pay for it. We don’t pay to the Mother Earth, do we? For sprouting our seeds, for doing all the rutus (means seasons) and all the wonderful things do we pay? In the same way we must realise in all humility that money cannot purchase God. In all humility. \n",

If you tell somebody that such and such guru is no good, people would really come out which [unclear] me. Now they are suffering, they have got problems, they think that ‘Yes, what Mother said is true’. But now they are suffering. So, the whole thing is that when there are seekers of truth also, how they get mislead. The greatest misleading thing is that the spurious gurus all around. The foremost thing that should happen to you if you have a guru, your health must improve. You must feel better in health. I find here, he gets heart attack, another one is Epilepsy, another one has got that, I have got such and such guru. I have got a back pain will you cure me Mother? I have got such and such sadguru. How can it be? Because as you have seen, when the Kundalini rises the first thing she gives you is the good health. And the sadguru is that who just gives you realisation other gurus who talk this read that, do that, say this mantra, this, that. This is of no use. It doesn’t help. The don’t know what is to be done. So, the sadguru is a person who has to be self-realised as well as he should know the Kundalini sastra. That is the pure sastra. \n",

So, this power you see down below as Kundalini is the fifth power. Left side right side sympathetic nervous system, then parasympathetic nervous system and whatever we have achieved in our evolution is the fourth one which we call as central nervous system. Now the fifth one is this one which is in a dormant state. When it is awakened then it passes through our fontanelle bone area lastly and connects you to the all-pervading Power of divine love. We see these beautiful flowers but we never even think how they are created by mother earth. These beautiful flowers are there because the same all-pervading Power looks after them. Who runs our heart if you ask the doctor, they say it is autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto, who manages our digestion. So, the answer is in becoming the spirit. \n",

The knowledge was kept a secret for quite some time till Shankaracharya – Adi Shankaracharya – the first Shankaracharya came on this earth. He also has not given all the details about Kundalini, but he has just given the names of various centres. So, the people started making research in Kundalini, but as I told you that you cannot put in effort: like if there is one light enlightened it can enlighten many lights, the Kundalini can be only awakened by an enlightened person. \n",

So you are not supposed to see the moon. The reason is, why it is said, that today we have to see Shri Ganesh, who is the Mother Earth, who acts through Mother Earth. Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth. So this time you must see the Mother Earth, the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today. The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha. So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon. Just see the Mother Earth. Because the Mother Earth in Her love and compassion has done so much for us, your Kundalini has done so much for you.

She’s just chastity. Can you believe it? What a power. Motherhood, everything is chastity. Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity. Purity is again the fragrance of chastity. Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity, a sense of chastity, which is not mental. If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid. Like some of the nuns are or some of those people who are austere, not that. Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you, which acts because it understands Me. She understands Me. She knows Me, She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection. So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste. People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that. Don’t waste your energy like this; you are saints, live like saints. Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new, something absurd, nonsensical. We don’t have to attract anyone. Chastity is the fragrance in the flower, which attracts the bees, is the honey of the flower, is the essence of our existence.\n",

      "Now, this Primordial Mother is expressed or is reflected as this Kundalini. And this Kundalini is your individual Mother. And She knows each and everything about you. Many people have said that Kundalini-awakening can harm you. How can you think that Kundalini can harm you when She is your Mother? When you were born, your mother took over all the problems of your birth. She did not trouble you. In the same way, when this Kundalini is awakened, She gives you this second birth without giving you any trouble. So, we have to understand that this Mother Earth cannot give us any trouble when She sprouts the seeds. In the same way, this Mother Kundalini doesn't give us any trouble. The Spirit is the reflection of the God Almighty in all of us. As there is only one God, all of us reflect the same. And so, we are collectively conscious when we become the Spirit. So, everyone has the Spirit reflected in his heart. So, when you feel this cool breeze, as you felt the other day, what you feel is this all-pervading Power. At the same time, you become collectively conscious. So, you can feel another person also on your fingertips. In the Quran, Mohammed Sahib has said, ‘At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.’ And this is the resurrection time. This is the last judgement, and you have to judge yourself. \n",

So, for the evolution you are not to pay anything, it is absurd! But so many ignorant ideas came up through blind faith.

This happening takes place, and for the first time you can feel this all-pervading Power on your fingertips as cool breeze.

For example, you can move any instrument that is here even without seeing the person. You can just move the things from here to there. But people must understand this is not God’s work. All these things are not God’s work. Like sitting down and talking to dead bodies and dead people is also very wrong, because there’s no justice done to that. For example, if you say somebody loves the father or the mother; they want to talk to them. Is very wrong because you must give them freedom, they belong to another area.

So you should say, ‘I am not guilty.’ Get over this feeling. ‘I am not guilty.’ That’s another thing the Christians are doing now is to ask people to confess. Why to confess? I mean Christ has done that for you. Whatever you have been committed, sins and all that, will be forgiven. If the Kundalini rises, it’s all forgiven. So you have to go on saying that, ‘I am not guilty.’ I can feel the centre now, sitting down here. Most of you are having this very big centre in you saying that you are guilty.

Is nothing but the two shadows of the present. For example, somehow by any chance if you can hang over the curve of the Earth, then you can see the future and the past, at one point, all the time and wherever you are is the present all the time. It’s something like that happens to you. It’s a new dimension of awareness where the mind takes a new dimension where you become the present.

      "So first thing you should understand that you cannot purchase Divine. You cannot pay for it, that is an insult. And secondly you cannot put in any effort for that. When you have to sprout a seed what do you do? You put it in Mother Earth, and She sprouts by itself spontaneously. It has got that force in it, only have to put it in Mother Earth. And Mother Earth by Her warmth germinates the seed. Do you get angry with Mother Earth for that if She has to do it, She has to do it. Whatever the sun has to do, has to do, and whatever you have to do, you can do and whatever the animals have to do, they do. If we understand that we have not yet achieved what we wanted to, then you will realise that there is a very little gap. Kundalini awakening takes split of a second, but it may take more time to rise in some people because of blockages in a centre or maybe some imbalances within us. \n",

      "So when you try to dominate others, I mean the sophisticated, the more sophisticated you get, the more sophisticated this ego gets and you are very pleased with that sophistication. You say ‘Sorry’, ‘Yes’, and so on, but inside a big Mr. Ego is developing like a balloon. It presses down on your superego, which is squashed. There is no longer a gap between the two, there is no more room for the superego and the ego presses down on it till you become aware of how colossal your ego has become. And then such a person looks for ways to escape, it he takes to alcohol which gives rise to superego or it takes to drugs and all kinds of escapism in life to run away from his own ego because he can’t bear it. Now the wobbling starts, the ego and superego start wobbling, and that’s how you get people who are absolutely confused. Moreover, to add up to the whole problem, the modern times are the ones that in this confusion Last Judgment has already started. Through your Kundalini awakening only you will judge yourself and correct yourself and you will enter into the kingdom of God. These confusions actually have led human beings into such frantic, precarious ages that Sahaja Yoga had to come on this Earth to solve the problems once for all. After getting realisation it’s so remarkable when you find your absolute through Kundalini awakening and see people they give up so many things overnight. \n",

You will feel it. Let’s raise it again. No the other way around. Do it like that. Do it thrice. Now you’ll feel it better. You feel very relaxed. That’s what it is. It’s all right, balanced now. Both the sides. Mostly you feel the left side, in any society which is Western, is weak. Because of the desire is less. As I told you the desire to achieve the Spirit is less. We don’t want action than the desire so you have to raise the left side and put it to the right. You’ll find the cool breeze on your head. It’s there. Now you can take it down also like this. Good idea. Put down the pressure on the Mother Earth. Raising and put it down. Again. Do it seven times. You will feel much better. Because now your hands are now emitting the cool breeze. Do it with respect to yourself. See now, if you have done seven times. Feel very relaxed. No thought in your mind. I hope you will all make it convenient to come on Sunday and whatever I will tell you, whatever needs to be done. \n",

      "Now this Ganesha within us resides in the Mooladhara Chakra. Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha and must have thought this is the Kundalini – because as a Mother I give them few marks for that – and that’s how they started all these perversions and wrong things about Ganesha. But He is embodiment of innocence. And later on you must read in Devi Bhagwat how He incarnated on this earth as Christ, and how He is going to come with His eleven powers on this earth as Kalki. \n",

      "Everything that has happened on this Earth has a divine plan, especially all the advents of people. Like Christ coming on this Earth, Moses taking people away from slavery, Krishna’s advent on this Earth, Rama’s coming on this Earth as a benevolent king. All these things have given us a special power within ourselves. These powers are all dormant. They are dormant, we can say they are sleeping, just like some candles which are not yet enlightened. When the Kundalini rises She enlightens these powers within us. So this pure desire that is within us to be one with the whole, this connects us to the whole; not only that, but it awakens all those deeper powers within us which are yet not awakened. \n",

When the Kundalini rises, and if this Agnya opens out, which is a very difficult thing – for others I have seen it’s very much difficult. But in Sahaj Yoga today it has become really easy to awaken Christ – all the sins get lost, completely absorbed. There’s no karmas left. \n",

      "That so many seekers are born, so many of them, they are really seekers, that’s a category, a category of human beings who are seeking something beyond. It’s a fact, I mean there was never such a time before that so many seekers were born on this Earth. This word was used sometimes for one single person or maybe about ten at the most but two thousand years back you could not find so many seekers on this Earth. I mean they are seekers, why there is so much seeking and why people are seeking, why they have this temperament of seeking, what is the reason? There must be some reason for it and as we all know in Sahaja Yoga that the Last Judgement has started and the Last Judgement is going to work out through the Kundalini awakening and everybody is now trying to seek in some way or another, aah the whole pattern has worked out in such a way that the seekers are born at this time and they have a background too. \n",

      "This is, you see it would be dangerous for anyone to so something which they do not know. For example if somebody says, ‘Car driving is dangerous,’ would be for a person like Me, I've never driven a car, you see. Next moment you'll find Me sitting on a tree and the car in [unclear]. [Shri Mataji laughs] Absolutely I tell you, I can't drive even one inch. So with such a person if I say car driving is the most dangerous thing, should you accept that? The same thing, somebody has to know the job. First of all it's a divine work, it's the work of God Almighty. Such a person has to be a holy person, has to be an honest person, has to be divine, otherwise they never come. [unclear] If you are not a holy person, can you raise the Kundalini, which is the holiest of holy within you? She doesn't understand unholy people. She doesn't like them. So such a person has to be something that, that's why it's difficult for these people who want to make money out of Kundalini awakening. Like some people might say that, ‘To sprout a seed is the most difficult thing. You have to pull out the seed, you have to pull out the primule,’ but for a farmer, it is very common knowledge, that you put it under the mother's care. The Mother Earth looks after the seed, very simple, She knows the job. So one has to know the job, and those who do not know they try all kinds of tricks, which is unauthorised, unholy and sinful, that's why they suffer. \n",

      "Now this may be little odd to you to share, that Mother is saying all this about Christ, but we can prove it. It can be proved that it was Christ who came on this earth, on this centre within us. Because when this power, which is going to give you your union, the power which is going to give you your Self-Realisation, which resides in the triangular bone as you see, is the pure desire of God Almighty. The pure desire of divine power that you should get your Realisation. It is not yet awakened – if it had been, you would have been realised. So it is called as residual because He has created the whole human being. Clearly it is sleeping: it has not manifested itself. And this power of Kundalini is the power you can see there, in the triangular bone, in three-and-a-half coils, sleeps for this awakening. And when She rises, when She comes up to this point and stops, we have to take the name of Christ, otherwise it won't rise. \n",

      "All these centres, which are governed by one of these leaders who came on this earth as human beings, to save us, to protect us, to guide us, to give us our sustenance, all of them are so important at different points that we have to find out at what point this Kundalini stops. With your naked eyes, you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini; with the naked eye you can see the rising of the Kundalini, and you can see the breaking of the Kundalini here. If you put your hand there, in the beginning you might feel a little throbbing, and the throbbing disappears. At that time, you'll start feeling in your hand a cool breeze blows – the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as you can say – it's blowing off your hand. It's actualisation. \n",

      "This happens only by Kundalini awakening, by nothing other. Suggestions people give: by… say… they say you can stand on your head; Kundalini doesn't rise. Some people will say, ‘You pay so much money, come for a course.’ It won't rise. It's like a primule in a seed that has to sprout. Now what do you do to sprout a seed, do you stand on your heads? Just you have to put to the Mother Earth; with Her warmth it comes out by itself. In the same way this Kundalini rises. We have to understand that you cannot pay for it. If you pay some money will the seed sprout? Or to the egg, will it become, will it become the bird? Nature's principles are so simple, so logical, so sensible that you don't have to read much to understand it. Actually with reading too much also we got complicated. Everybody else is in our head, we are nowhere, we are lost. \n",

      "All such false certificates are for whom? For whose conviction? You are your own judge. You have to judge yourself. And you have to be fair to yourself and to nobody else. You have to be kind to yourself that you are born on this Earth to be born again and that you should get it. There is nothing else I ask you. Because within us all these things have been nicely planted without your awareness. All these seven centres you see are very nicely planted. They are there. And all the deities of different characters, like innocence is the first deity, are there. When the Kundalini is awakened, She awakens the different deities. By awakening those deities, you get the reward of those deities. As I told you yesterday when it crosses this, you get Christ awakened. Of course, not this, it is inside on the crossroads of optic chiasma, you can say, which there is a centre called as Agnya chakra. And this centre looks after your pituitary and pineal body. When the Kundalini rises, She enlightens all these centres. Christ is enlightened. And the ego and superego which create the idea of sin and the idea of karmas is sucked in – through Christ. It is said that He died for us, for our sins. It's a fact. \n",

      "It's just like sprouting a seed when you put it into the Mother Earth. It is absolutely spontaneous. Everything that is living is spontaneous. So there are no practices as such before Realisation. After Realisation, you have to know how to maintain it. And we have a nice centre here. You can find out. It is 31 College Road [speaking aside: Is it she staying there?] And also they have now started a little shop for people because that was a very good way of contacting people. I don't know the address of the shop or any of these places. There are many places here in Brighton. We have got Sahaja Yogis who are very good. They know all about Kundalini they are just like you to look at. They are very normal people. But they know about your chakras, they know about themselves, and they can tell you how to preserve this Realisation. All the knowledge will be yours. Because now the light is within you, you can see also for yourself. And by practising it, you'll get it, you don't have to pay for it, nothing. \n",

That you can now test their vibrations and see for yourself how She has worked very hard. She has created all this beautiful universe. She has created you also. She has created the Kundalini within you. She represents the beautiful nature we can say. In Her company, in Her bounties when you are drenched and you all meet each other, you see for yourself that how She blesses all of you just the same.

But Her steps are very large also are roundish. She curved. Can you imagine? They're curved as if part of the Kundalas they are. And they are three and a half in height, you can see that, in height and in width also. Like every place is made of big, I mean the three are made of big stones and the last one is made of the small, three and a half, and they go in a curve. And that is Sanctum Sanctorum nobody can go inside. Now what an expression it was. This was the early expression and Athens is after Her name Athena. If you see the face also you will find your Mother very much there. I've got the photographs and all that which I will show you later on. But what I'm saying the Mother Earth has done Her job. People have done their job. Christ or we can say Mohammed or Buddha, Kabira, anyone of them; they have done their jobs, all right. They have worked for you. They have created places within you. They have done their job. Now it is you who are on the stage, not Me. Sahasrara has to work it out. And Sahasrara always surrounds the Heart. You are enlightened by your Spirit, which resides in your Heart. And the whole Sahasrara’s mandalas are around the Heart. So as you are now the temple of that Spirit, you are the Heart.

In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Mahavishnu. But I will tell about His advent when He came on this Earth. We say, He is the gate; He is the door. He is the door below the limbic area. And the limbic area is the Kingdom of God. Where one has to centre, the attention has to enter. How you enter into it? Not bodily, but your attention has to enter it. Your attention is spread out in this area. But not there – it has to enter through that area into the limbic area and ultimately, is the fontanel area. It becomes soft and the Kundalini has to come out and with the cool breeze, this is your actual baptism. Is not the baptism you go to some theological college to learn and say all right – I baptise – it’s all artificial. It’s absolutely artificial. That’s not the way you can baptise.

After piercing six chakras, it reaches Brahmarandhra. and there it pierces your vertex and becomes one with the power that is present all around. It is known as yoga. Thing to understand here is that we all know that if we sow a seed on this Mother Earth, then it automatically germinates. How it grows? Because that seed has the power and Mother Earth also has the power and she awakens it. Shri Ramdas Swami who was guru of Shivaji, was asked by someone that how much time does it take to awaken the Kundalini. He answered, ‘within a second’.

      "Now as it is we have all these things just built in within us, like a seed if you put it in the Mother earth sprouts, the ‘Kundalini rises’ but the ‘Kundalini’ is the power of pure desire, all our desires are impure, for example you want to have a house, you want to have then carpets, you want to have furniture, you want to have a car, then we want to have a big car. They told me that people borrow money here to buy a big car, but I said why? because they want to show that the car should be big, I said why? One gentleman told me why, his secretary’s car is four times bigger than mine, but why? They said, because they want to show but to whom? Nobody sees, nobody knows, who is the owner of the car? It’s a Myth. Another thing, I was told in this country everybody is indebted. I mean then how are you rich.\n",

      "If there is no morality in culture… that culture is foreign to us. Because we are ancient people, and also the climate in India is so good, that you need not sort of worry about going out or anything. People live in forests just to find out why we are on this earth. Just to get an answer for this question. And they discovered it, long time back they discovered it, long time back they discovered, fourteen thousand years back, Markandeya has written about Kundalini, can you imagine! So like that it has been there this knowledge, but it was not exposed to general public, so far because they thought they are not yet ready to take it, if they get a little bit, they may try to misuse or something. And out of this great knowledge, you see this, now in these modern times, somehow, I have been able to achieve something little more, that you can get your amass realisation. That means it’s not necessary for you to go to Himalayas, stand on your heads, do anything fasting or anything.\n",

      "So, some people afterwards found it, that it was not proper, like Buddha, Mahavira, Mohammed Sahib, Nanaka: all of them found that it’s not proper to talk about the flowers, because people get lost, so better talk about the honey. So, one was ‘sakara’[having form] – that is, with the form – another formless, so ‘nirakara’[formless]: they started talking about the formless. This was also talk, and talk, and talk. But to reach the honey, you have to be a bee, and that’s what is Self-Realisation is.Now this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone, which is called as ‘sacrum’ in the medical term. In Latin, ‘sacrum’ means ‘sacred.’ That means the Greeks knew about it, otherwise why should they call it a sacred bone? This Kundalini is awakened as a living process, like the seed sprouts when it is put in the Mother Earth; spontaneously rises, passes through six centres, the seventh centre is below. And the seventh centre is responsible for our excretion. It stops its function when it starts rising. \n",

      "Real method is that this triangular bone which has got this Kundalini as in itself, is the force, has to rise, actually just like a primule in a seed. It’s a living process, like a seed when you put it in the Mother Earth the primule of that seed just rises and comes upward, by itself. It comes upward and creates the plant. It is not that you pull out the primule and say that, ‘This is the plant’ or you just bless the seed and say, ‘Now the plant has been created.’ It’s a living process. Now we have reached at a stage where we call ourselves as human beings and you know very well that our central nervous system has achieved lots of sensitivities, which the animals don’t have. Like, they don’t understand beauty, animals don’t understand dirt, filth. You can take an animal through dirt and filth and you cannot take a human being through that. Because a human being can understand but a dog or a horse cannot understand that this is dirty or filthy.\n",

If you go any time to visit the ranges of Himalayas. If you go any time to visit the ranges of Himalayas who will be surprised the tremendous vibration flow from Himalayas towards the sky. You can see lights and lights going up if you are a realised soul, otherwise you may not see it's a tremendous country, its tremendous opportune time.

      "Now this is the brain of Virat which is the Sahasrara and in the heart resides the Spirit. But once you achieve that state of nirvikalpa then the Spirit resides here at Sadashiva, at this stage there are seven stages higher than that, but at least three can be easily achieved if you try the collective method of Sahaja Yoga, collective method by which you can correct yourself. Just watch yourself, face yourself and enjoy the way you are correcting yourself. For the first time you start seeing yourself am I like this, all right I am going to put this right. You will see yourself as centres, you won't feel bad or hurt. You will correct yourself and thus you will correct the whole society. No use crying, weeping, saying that is wrong with the society, this is wrong with the society, do this, do that. Everything can be brought around if you all decide, even all these people if you all decide to do the collective work of Sahaja Yoga I can assure you things are going to work out, or going to work out very fast. Very fast but let that Kundalini be awakened in Kolhapur, we have a God, the Goddess of Mahalakshmi is the SushumnaNadi expressed is come out of the Mother Earth and there people are saying udhe udhe ambe, udhe udhe ambe, udhe udhe ambe, udhe udhe ambe, what is that, she is Mahalakshmi, why are you saying Ambe, all the time Ambe is Mahakali's power, because Kundalini is the power of Mahakali. So they are saying that how the Mahalakshmi, the Sushumnais all right, now let the Ambe get raised means let the Chandi raise, let the Kundalini raise within us and this is what is going to happen to all of us once that starts you will be amazed how great you are. Don’t run after petty things of life. Don’t think that these petty things are going to give any happiness. Open your Sahasrara, I know it is not possible for all the people to get it, but so many in this country can get it for nothing at all because this country is specially placed, the people in this country.\n",

Now what I have told you about Adam and Eve, we have found out, said by also John in his Gnostics book. It’s very surprising. They always told you that Christ must have told you many things, but they are not in the Bible. So if you understand that this Adi Shakti came as a serpent, the Adi Kundalini part of Her, and told the Adam and Eve, especially Eve, that she should ask for the fruit of knowledge to be eaten. The reason I gave you is exactly written there that the Mother power, the feminine power, didn't want Her children to live like animals without understanding what is the knowledge of the higher realms, not giving them chance to rise higher through their freedom and then to higher and higher awareness. It was the concern of the Mother.\n",

Then He took the Mother Earth towards the moon so that it cools down and then He moves the Mother Earth towards the sun and brought it to a point where the life could be sustained. That is how the life started on earth. In the Puranas it's described that there were Avatars of Shri Vishnu on this earth who one by one lead for the evolution. Like that you have seen we have Macha Avatar, Kurma Avatar and all those things about which you know and the new Sahaja Yogis should be told about. Ultimately this is the situation now at the Sahasrara where I had to come. At this stage the main job is to give realisation, to raise your Kundalini, that is My main job. And that's what has to happen in a very large scale. \n",

      "Now we know how Shri Gauri established Shri Ganesha. She was married but had not yet met with Her husband. That time, She had gone for Her bath and after removing the dirt from Her body—now if you have vibrations in your entire, if your entire body has the divine vibrations and if this divine vibration is flowing and if that is taken in the dirt of one’s body, then that too has divine vibrations—She created Ganapati out of this dirt and kept it outside Her bathing place. Now see, She kept Him outside the bathing place and not in the front from where the all the filth is flowing. Many of you must be knowing, when the water from the bathroom flows then many a times the leaves from patra, or some people plant lotus flowers also and they grow there quite well – it is quite surprising, the lotus flowers grow only where there is a puddle – same is the example of Shri Ganesh. Means where the dirtiest region of the house is, on that dirty region of the house this lotus has bloomed and with its perfume it imparts its fragrance to this dirt. This power of his also greatly helps us in our lives. The dirt that we see in us is secured due to the Ganesh element. Now this Ganesh element has to first perform pujan of Kundalini, means of Shri Gauri first. Means your Ganesh element first has to perform your Kundalini’s pujan. In short, to bring abodhita in us. You will be surprised when Kundalini gets awakened, that time the fragrance of the Ganesh element spreads in the entire body. [Aside: These are realised, should please sit here. It does not matter.] Many people, especially Sahaja Yogis, sense the fragrance when Kundalini gets awakened. Because Ganesh element is made out of Earth element, or the Earth itself is made out of Ganesh element. This Earth is made out of Shri Mahaganesh. So the presence of Shri Ganesh in us, that too is comprised of the Earth element. \n",

      "Now we know that all fragrances emanate out of Earth. The fragrances of all flowers emanate out of Earth. That is why when Kundalini gets awakened, many people sense different types of aromas. Not only this, many Sahaja Yogis tell Me that, ‘Shri Mataji when we remember You we sense very intense fragrance and such fragrances emanate from Your body also.’ Many people misunderstand, that: ‘Shri Mataji wears some perfume,’ but it is not so. If the Ganesh element is wakened in you then the fragrance emanates from within. Different types of fragrances emanate out of a person. But you must be knowing that there are such people in world who call themselves as sadhus or saints and they cannot live with fragrance. They call themselves ‘God’ and they cannot tolerate fragrance. We have explicit writings on this. You read any deity’s description, especially that of Shri Ganesha, that He loves fragrance. Not only that; He loves flowers. And He loves lotus. Similarly it is written in the description of Shri Vishnu, written in the description of the Goddesses. This means that those people who do not like fragrance, who cannot tolerate fragrance, they have some serious flaw and they are against the God Almighty. They do not have the power of the Almighty for sure. The person who cannot tolerate fragrance at all, he certainly has some anti-God elements in him. Because fragrance is a great principle of the Earth element. There are many names for it in the language of yoga. It’s no use telling about it that, as you would keep thinking about it. \n",

      "At Delhi, there is one gentleman called Dr. Batra. He happened to come for a programme just like you people. Those days I used to cure people, now I don’t do that. He said, ‘Shri Mataji, see me. For one month I have been suffering. I am being bitten by scorpions. My Kundalini has been awakened. People say this and that.’ So I said, ‘Sit down for two minutes.’ Still he was impatient, so I went to him and calmed him down in five minutes. The reason was Mother Earth. He was standing on the ground. ‘You sat down on the ground, I am very happy. Today is an absolutely proper coincidence.’ The Mother Earth sucked out all his heat. Now how will you tell Mother Earth, ‘O Mother Earth, you suck all my heat’? She will not suck it out, but she sucks it for a Sahaja Yogi. The reason is that once the Ganesh element is awakened in you, and as the same element is present in the Earth, the Earth is operational on the same element, she sucks it. That is why one should keep this element awakened in us, the human should preserve the chastity. \n",

      "I have told you earlier that Jesus Christ possessed a number of powers and that He was endowed with the powers of Ekadesha  Rudra. Then how is it that He was crucified and could not save Himself from this dreadful event. Jesus Christ, with His several powers, could have completely annihilated His opponents in a moment. His Mother, Mary, was none else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother Herself. She also could not bear the atrocities on Her son. And yet it happened. Perhaps God desired to stage a drama. Really speaking, Jesus Christ was beyond happiness or sorrow and He had to enact the drama in perfect and faultless manner. How foolish were those who crucified Him! Jesus Christ rode on a donkey so that foolishness among the people of those days could be eradicated. If you suffer from headache and you pray to Jesus Christ to forgive all those who have put you in trouble, you will be cured of your headache without the aid of any medicines. However, before such a thing can happen, you have to awaken your Kundalini by accepting Sahaja Yoga, and get Self-Realisation. The reason is that the Agnya Chakra, which is the Jesus principle in you, becomes active only after awakening of the Kundalini in Sahaja Yoga and not otherwise. Agnya Chakra is very subtle. The physicians are also unable to notice it. There is a very subtle door in this chakra. That is why Jesus Christ said, ‘I am the door.’ Jesus Christ incarnated on this Earth for facilitating the passage through this door, and He Himself was the first to pass through it. \n",

      "The Virata has made you, so let the power of Virata flow through you and understand the meaning of Self. In order to explain the meaning of the Self, Jesus Christ incarnated on this Earth with His seat in the Agnya Chakra. Agnya Chakra is very complex, and is the seat of the subtle principle of Aumkara or Pranava. In fact Jesus Christ is the Aumkar, the Pranava. The connection between the Kundalini and Jesus Christ is the same as the one that exists between the moon and the moonlight or the sun and the sunlight. The Kundalini, that is Mother Gauri, created Shri Ganesha by Her willpower, tapasya and noble deeds. It was when Shri Ganesha prepared Himself for incarnation that Jesus Christ was born. \n",

There are many real seekers and he must be worried about all these seekers and he must have arranged something for them and that is how Christ came on this earth to guide you. He came on this earth to guide and tell us that you can find the truth by your second birth. You are to be born again. You are to be born again, then there are people who just believe that I am born again, you see self-opinionated, I’m all right! I’ve found it! Stupid people, they just believe, certify themselves they have found it. They just give themselves a certificate, oh I’ve found it, but who is the loser? It’s not God. He is there, to reveal himself to you if you want to know him, through your evolution, through your effortlessness. But as you have seen Patanjali yoga shastra was written for the central people, for the real seekers but people took out of Patanjali also what suited them is the physical exercise, I mean just imagine, it is like a person who has been invited to dinner is doing dish-washing, it’s that stupid. And that book, even today thank God, despite all the intellectuals attacks and all nonsenses, he does talk of the formless not of the form so much but he does say that you have to neutralise your effort, [some Sanskrit words] you have to neutralise your thought which are [Sanskrit words] and in the absence of that thought only the Kundalini will rise. \n",

It is a living process. If you understand it is a living process, it can never rise. Because, in any living process, as you know, that is, if there is a seed has to sprout if you stand on your head or on your leg, it is not going to sprout. It will sprout if you put it in the Mother Earth. It is a living process. So, all these things are not going to help; the only thing it might help in your health or something. But that too, the way we do Hatha Yoga is very dangerous. Because of we, as if we put all the medicines into our hands. And we start taking all the medicines without understanding, what it is. So, supposing a chakra is not all right, you might have to do a certain ‘asana’ in Sahaja Yoga, but scientifically knowing what is to be done. It is not that, every asana you are doing. That is very wrong. That spoils your chakras. This is how scientifically you have to know, this is how this asana is done. \n",

      "One extreme is that, there is the greatest filth and the worst possible things are born and on the other side the saints are also born. And the saints are the one who are seeking. Those who are seeking God, are all Saints, otherwise they would be seeking all the mud and the muck. But they are seeking God. They are seeking something divine. So, all the people who are seeking are the Saints. So many saints were never born on this mother earth, as they are born now and so many rogues were also never born. All the Rakshasas, all these Devils who used to be born after one thousand years or so, at least there used to be 500 years or so. But now all of them have been born now especially from the last I think thirty forty years they have been taking birth. And such great saints are born these days, you have no idea. Within 10 years you will see how many great Saints will be coming up, because they’re still young boys. Absolutely ___. They know everything about Kundalini, they know about me and all that. Such superior class of people are taking birth. You are also saints because you are seeking. What is the definition of a Saint? A saint is the one who seeks. And the one who has sought, the one who has found it, has been blessed, is a realised soul. (53. 36)\n",

      "Let's have our realisation now all of us, but I don't promise as I said it's your own lookout. If you believe in our, according to Indian thing if you believe, according to our former karmas according to our previous things that we get Atma Sakshatkar, because it's the highest to have. So let's see what happens. And also My compassion, My love, My desire that you all should get your realisation and establish it and become powerful Sahaja Yogis and understand it fully. Now those who are here have to follow what I say, is very simple method by which you help yourself. As I said you are your own guru and on different chakras we have to work it out and it works. So please take out your shoes for one reason, that the Mother Earth helps us to sort of earth some of the problems that have come from the Mother Earth. Now, you have to keep your eyes shut throughout, not to open your eyes. The reasons are many but one of them is that the centre of Agnya, which is placed between the pituitary and the pineal body, is a very important centre. It is the gate and it doesn't open if your eyes are open outside just now. So please keep your eyes shut till then and maybe the Kundalini may not also rise. The whole attitude should be that I should get my realisation. You're not going to lose anything, I don't take any money, nothing of the kind, and there is nothing to gain out of it anyway. So just you have to gain something out of it so, in a humble way, you have to sit down and put your hands on your lap. Those people who have come for the first time, or are standing there, can come forward here and sit down and the Sahaja Yogis should give them places. Sahaja Yogis should never take the first places, I would request, it would be a good idea. All right, just try to sit on the side if possible, those who have come for the first time.\n",

But those who are sitting on the ground are all right, they can sit with [Hindi], on the ground is all right. [Hindi] Now put your both the hands towards Me, as I told you, and close your eyes. We have to have a proper attitude towards ourselves. Firstly, it's going to be the happiest thing that is going to happen to us, and the highest thing that we have been asking for ages. So we are not to be in any way under any tension about it, it's really happening to all of us. Sit with a very cheerful mind, not frivolous but cheerful mind. And secondly you have to respect yourself. If there is any guilt or anything in your mind, it won't work out, as I told you. You must know you're saints, born to get Self-Realisation. You are, as described by William Blake, you are men of God, who have to become prophets, who will have powers to make others prophets.

So, to develop it, you have to have the ascent of your Kundalini. When the Kundalini rises, then only, the Spirit can be awakened within you. There’s no other way around. People say that there can be another way, this can be done, that can be done. There can be no other way for a seed to be sprouted.

      "[23.35] This is how the whole story was built-up and that’s how we have to get our realisation. But it takes hardly any time. It is called in Sanskrit ‘tatshat’ means the same moment – there’s not a split of a second also in between – tatshana, immediately it does. Like if you put the seed in a, in the Mother Earth’s care, in Her warmth, immediately it starts sprouting – you can’t say when it started. If it is wet, immediately it starts sprouting so, if there is somebody like that which we call the ‘Sandrakaruna’, the one who has got that moisture and that compassion of the Mother Earth that person can instantly raise the Kundalini, is all described in the, in the Scriptures in India and many others but the problem is that Bible being a very microscopic book cannot contain everything that is knowledge nor can it contain a person like Christ. You have to go to other books to find out what Christ was, how He came on Earth, what was His background – you cannot just say that, “I believe in Christ and I go to church so I have the selected one – Christ will catch my hand and will take me to Heaven.” Is a wrong idea people have and if you live with that idea, I’m sure, a day will come when you will have to repent. Christ Himself has said that, “You are to be born again,” and when Nichodamus asked Him, “What do You mean, have I to enter into the womb of my mother?” He clearly said that, “No, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh,” but I’m saying, you’re to be born of the Holy Ghost and this is the Holy Ghost that is to give you your re-birth, this is the Holy Ghost which is your mother – everybody has an individual mother – and She’s just waiting for this moment to give you Self-Realisation and that’s how you get your Self-Realisation. What we call is baptism, is the same as Self-Realisation but it has to be a true thing.\n",

Now, here are so many people sitting here… The Kundalini is your Mother, and awakening Her, how can there be a danger? Will there be a danger if you have to sprout a seed? It's a living process. How can there be a danger? You see these are stupid people or these are unholy people, unauthorised. They don't know a word about Kundalini. They try to put their hands onto wrong things, do all wrong things. It can be a possession. It can be anything. They don't know a word, they have no authority. You have to have authority. Divine authority should be there to raise the Kundalini. Like the Mother Earth, if you put a seed in the Mother earth, it will sprout. But supposing you open it and operate it and try to take out the primule, it will die. All right?\n",

So if you are ordained, not through any church or any temple or anything, but it's a God's ordain. Like, we can say, John the Baptist had that power when he came on this Earth. And there were many in India who had this power, who are ordained, I should say, who have a divine Power within them flowing, who are capable of raising the Kundalini. They do it without any trouble. Even seeing them, you might get your rising. You see from my photograph, Gavin has got realisation; he got his realisation from my photograph, can you believe it? From my photograph only. So many got it from my photograph. So it can happen. It is a thing which is to be understood with proper patience, that God exists, and He has His own methods, His laws, and the way He works out is dynamic. Once you become that dynamic being, you will start seeing those working through your own hands. You do it. \n",

It is still expecting that great happening for which you are born, for which you are seeking, for which you are on this Earth, She’s there. You cannot think of any human mechanism of that delicacy, that sensitivity, that beauty, that understanding and that strength. It’s hopeful against hopes. And that is the thing, still preserved there because it is protected by your innocence which is still there little bit left. So whatever you may try with your innocence, as you cannot create a complete vacuum, you cannot get rid of it, the hole. So whatever part is left of your innocence is guarding that. And that essence is still waiting; is there. Whatever you might have done, whatever wrong you might have done, makes no difference, because Kundalini is intact.\n",

      "Now the same Shri Ganesha incarnates on this earth much later as Mahavishnu at this point as our Lord Jesus Christ. So when people say that ‘you have to go through Christ’, it's a fact and ultimately the Kundalini has to pass through that centre. At the Sistine chapel that's what Michelangelo has painted, it is this centre. This centre is placed between the pituitary and the pineal body in the optic chiasm means the crossing of the optic nerve. And some people call it a ‘third eye’. And it has to be pierced through ultimately, otherwise, you cannot get your realisation. So the message of Christ's resurrection is this: that He crossed through that small gate to become the Resurrected so that you all could be resurrected. So the time of your resurrection is now. But it cannot be done by just an artificial type of baptism. There Christ has to be awakened only through the awakening of the Kundalini by someone who knows the job, who is authorised by God, not by a theological university. Actually, they will never recognise Christ. Christ has said, ‘You will be calling me, 'Christ, Christ', and I won't know you.’\n",

      "If they had just mentioned just the quality of Christ the Indians would have known what is He. He was Mahavishnu which is promised thousands of years back, that he will come and He will be the Saviour, he will work for sucking our ego and superego. Now when the whole situation was that they did not know that He has arrived and that He is the same as Mahavishnu described, naturally people still went on with their karma theories. Though it is in our ancient astrology described that this time will be coming and that there will be a method by which this Kundalini will be awakened spontaneously and people will get their realisation. So people were waiting only for this, not understanding that Mahavishnu has not yet arrived and how is this going to happen. As everywhere people were so very money-oriented and they created big religious things and temples, and this and that, and making money out of it. Everywhere where the vibrations are and where the real has come out of the Mother Earth there is a big, nice temple and now they are making big money out of that. Recently, I am happy to say, that most of them are now taken over by the government. Of course, the government also doesn't understand anything about vibrations. At least they will not make money out of it. \n",

      "Shri Mataji: Kundalini awakening happens in Sahaja way. It’s just like a seed which has potential to grow into thousands of trees. When a seed is sowed in earth, it germinates in Sahaja way. Likewise, all these powers are there within us in potential state, which if awakened a human can become very powerful. When Kundalini awakens, it passes through six chakras, not seven. First chakra is placed under the Kundalini, which protects it and looks after its purity. A man who has lived a saintly life and even when his past life has been saintly, such a person’s Kundalini awakens very quickly. And after awakening she attains union with all-pervading Power of Chaitanya. This is called Yoga. Anything else, like bending your body, doing acrobat is not Yoga.\n",

There is no artificiality in this, no word trap, no exercise required, no standing on your head; no need to wear saffron clothes, or to live like an ascetic. This is an internal process. Like if you want to sprout seeds, you have to put them in Mother Earth. Then they will sprout very quickly and spontaneously. Can any of you explain this? You cannot tell how one flower is transformed into a fruit. This is definitely a unique phenomenon. And this is how Sahaja Yoga works. How it happens, we can share with you because all the natural processes related to human beings should be known and experienced. Within you all lies the power called Kundalini which is residing within you in the triangular bone. Only with the rising of this power can you get the knowledge of your Spirit.\n",

      "Before we start, I must tell you that it cannot be forced on anyone. I respect your freedom. Only those who really want Self-Realisation should be in the hall, otherwise they should leave the hall. No doubt, all of you can get realisation, but as Christ has said that, humble in heart will inherit the Earth. So, we have to be humble about it. If you are arrogant, the Kundalini won't rise. You have to ask for it, because Kundalini is the power of pure desire. So, you should have pure desire to ascend. There are three conditions before we start it. The first one is that, you all have to be absolutely self-confident that you all are going to get your Self-Realisation tonight. But you have to be little attentive. The second condition is that you are not to feel guilty at all. If you have committed mistakes, it's all right. After all you are human beings, you are not gods. If you have committed mistakes, then just face them and don't put them as guilt in you. Because if you feel guilty, this centre on the left side gets absolutely into trouble and then you can get diseases like angina, or spondylitis, or lethargic organs. So, why feel guilty? Forget the past. In short you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. If you have to enter into the Kingdom of God, forgive yourself.\n",

      "So this is a new race of people who have to come up who are expressing the divinity that is within them. It's all within you. Only thing you have to get connected with that all-pervading Power of divine love of God. If you can get connected with that power, then your divinity will start expressing. For example, see now these lamps, these lights are there. If they are not connected to the mains they cannot show the light. This one [the microphone], if it is not connected to the mains has no meaning. In the same way, we have to be connected to that power and that power exists. Whether it exists or not it's better to find out. Instead of that if you just say – some people do say, ‘There is no God.’ − it's absolutely unscientific. First find out if there is God or not and then you can say ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ In the same way if there is an all-pervading Power which is doing all this living work – we see these beautiful flowers here – we take them for granted. We don't even think how can this Mother Earth give this colour, give this beautiful fragrance, how She creates. We just accept it. Look at our eyes, how beautifully they are made. We never even think how we have become from amoeba to this stage a human being. How it ever happened? Who did all this? What was that power? And that power is this all-pervading Power which does all the living work, all the living work, that pulsates in our heart and that is the one we have to get connected to. And this is the reflection within us – is of the Holy Ghost as we say in the Bible – is this, lying in the triangular bone, is this power of Kundalini. Now, it is this power which works out your Self-Realisation in the sense it raises itself, awakens, goes through six centres, pierces through the fontanel bone area, which is the actualisation of baptism. It has to be an actualisation. Somebody just puts some water on your head, ‘Now you are baptised.’ You do not. What has happened? What is so special? Everybody is the same, whether they are Hindu, Christians, Muslims: no difference at all.\n",

      "This is the new dimension you acquire in your awareness. Thus, you can help so many people. Means you can raise the Kundalini of others, with your hands. It all happens spontaneously. You don't have to pay for this. This is just evolution. Why did we evolve? Because God Almighty loved us. He wanted us to enter into His kingdom. And now it is going to happen spontaneously. You can't pay for it. You also must know you can't work it out yourself. It works spontaneously, like a seed sprouts by itself. As the seed has the built in power, built in power, to sprout, you too, you have the built in power to achieve that state. But as the Mother Earth has to do the job, somebody who is a evolved soul has to do it.\n",

      "I have come on this earth, to give you the complete knowledge of your Spirit and of your being. And to give you that enlightened dimension to your awareness by which you will be able to make out who is real, and who is unreal. After your enlightenment, you will know how to use this power which is radiating through you. You will know how to cure yourself and cure others, mentally and physically. You will know sitting down here what is wrong with a person about whom you are thinking. You will jump into the realm of Brahma, that is the divine Power, which is all-pervading. Will jump into the realm of Brahma, of the divine Power. The divine power, which is all-pervading. This power organises the whole universe. This changes these flowers into fruits and seeds. This power sprouts the seeds. Kundalini is the representative of the same power. That is your individual; everybody has their own Mother sitting down there. She loves you and She is waiting for an opportunity to give you this realisation. She loves you. This has to be performed now and now, because the blossom time has come. Many beautiful flowers have to find their fruitful meaning. It will happen to all the nations. \n",

      "Then other problems like political, economic and all these problems also I tried to study because they became so important for human beings, which are of absolutely artificial value, but they did. So I had to see to that, what makes them do this and what makes them do that. Sort of a human behaviour science I had to study for years. And then as you start unfolding or you can say unentangling or disentangling, or taking out the knots of a bundle, you reach a point where all the knots are opened out and one knot is still left, you see, which is to be opened out. And that was done on the 5th of May 1970. And once that had done, the collective phenomena started working. And the greatest collective phenomena was that the Shri Chakra being on this earth, could be felt through your fingers. This was never before so, nobody felt the fingers enlightened, nobody felt the vibrations on the fingers as such, but they felt it within themselves because the rising of the Kundalini and everything and the way they developed themselves inside, they were more concerned about one individual. They developed their inner being much more than their collective being. \n",

      "The reason is that you are now working in a way that we call as akarma. Akarma is that when you do something but you do not feel you are doing something. When you are not conscious of it, that is akarma. When you are doing something, and you think that you are doing this work, that work, that thing, then it is a karma. But now the karma has become an akarma, not that you are not doing anything. You are doing so many things but you do not feel that you are doing it because you have now doing been doing akarma and all living work is akarma. Like the Mother Earth, She sprouts seeds − She is not aware of it. In the same way you people are raising the Kundalini, you are not aware of it. And when you are not aware of it, you don't even want to think, ‘How it is happening? See me, a human being raising a hand like this definitely the Kundalini rises, I see it comes out of the head. It happens, I see this, it's a fact. Then how is it that this is happening? What is the process? What is the procedure? How it has worked? Did I make any mistakes?’ You never think like that. ‘Did I do it in a wrong manner?’ You don't think. Sir, just you start − raise the Kundalini. You just don't bother to find out, ‘Have I given myself a bandhan or not? Have I seen the gentleman what his vibrations are like?’ No, you just go ahead, raise your hands, yes. You are quite aware of one thing: that you are a realised soul and that you can raise the Kundalini. \n",

      "So now what happens with Kundalini, when she raises, what she does she nourishes the centres, she nourishes all the centres, because that is the vital power which is meet all the living work and that power [unclear] but when it comes out of this Brahma Randra, then it becomes one with this all-pervading Power, which is the real yoga. That is the real union not other yogas - standing on your heads and breaking your bones that's not the thing. The yoga, real scriptured yoga, is when you become one with this all-pervading Power, once you are one with that all-pervading Power it starts going into your body. It works through your body that you can feel it on your fingertips [unclear]. This is your own. There is no obligation, you can't pay for it, nothing. It's your own. Just like a seed -you can put it in the mother Earth, it sprouts. It happens like that. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to take a Sanyasa. You don't have to give up anything. Nothing outside. It is all within you, is there, and I have seen with Indians, specially, very easy to raise the Kundalini, very easy. With the Western, you see them work quite hard but now they are also alright, but with Indians they are specially, they are something special about them; that they get their realisation in no time. \n",

      "- Should we? Now, for that experience, one humble thing I've to tell you, you have to do, is to take out your shoes because we have to use the Mother Earth for taking out our problems, so just take out your shoes − it helps. With this experience also people get well, their health improves automatically, I don't have to do anything − it just happens − they get well. Now, one has to remember that all of us have got Kundalini within ourselves but everybody has got their individual problem so, it cannot be guaranteed to everyone. Ultimately everybody will get it, ultimately but maybe, some people may not get today, may get it tomorrow − doesn't make any difference whatsoever. Some seeds sprout today, some seeds sprout tomorrow − makes no difference. So nobody should be anxious about it, worried about it, ultimately you'll get it, all of you, I promise you that but I cannot guarantee today but ultimately all of you should get your realisation − that's your right. Secondly, you have to close your eyes and till I tell you keep them closed − don't open your eyes, is important because of this centre if the eyes are open, it doesn't allow the Kundalini to rise − that's our experience. So please keep your eyes shut. Put your both the hands in this way, in this way comfortably on your laps − not like that, not like this but like this because these are the five centres you can see, five, six and seven centres on the left and the right-hand side so if you put your hands like this, the energy passes through you, it informs the Kundalini and Kundalini rises.\n",

      "It's not like the economics that you want today this, tomorrow that and it is never satiable in general. It gets completely… the thing that you want is the entire source of satisfaction. But is the movement is upward; the Kundalini doesn't go downward towards the gravity, towards the matter. It comes up. It moves upward and pierces through this fontanel bone area and you get your Self-Realisation. This is what you should ask from any guru. All the rest of it is useless. How can you pay for it? Can you show rupee to that Kundalini? It's a living process of the living evolution, which has to take place. You have to achieve the epitome of your life by this. How are you going to do it? Are you going to do it by standing on your head? Any living process like a sprouting of a seed, how do you do it? You put the seed in the Mother Earth. And She has the power and She just sprouts it. In the same way it has to happen that it should sprout. In that same manner it should sprout spontaneously. Sahaj. Saha − with, ja − born. This is born with you. To get this yoga is your birth-right. Get it, and for Indians it's a special blessing that they get it very fast. Just like their independence, without any effort. Without much struggle, I should say. Others have struggled much more than us. When you get that you also lose it very fast.\n",

      "Patanjali has called this as Ritambhara Pragnya. It is known by many names. Is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So who is the Holy Ghost? Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother. In the Bible, She's called as the Holy Ghost or the cool breeze, which the disciples felt, but nothing more. But the Greeks call this Athena. Atha means primordial. That is how one has to understand that this Kundalini, this Power is the reflection of this Holy Ghost within us. And the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. First you have to have your realisation and then only you have to know what you are, about everything, that's all. It is all built in within you. Like in a seed it is built in to sprout and the Mother Earth it is built in that She can sprout. This happening, when it takes place, all these centres get nourished. All world problems are due to human beings and all human problems are due to these chakras. If your chakras are put right, all your problems can be solved. So the first thing that happens to you that, you get your physical, mental and your emotional being absolutely into balance.\n",

      "Moreover the centre, which is formed by the optic chiasma, is like this, very, very constricted. This centre can only open like this if you forgive everyone. Otherwise you will miss because Kundalini won't rise. So please forgive everyone without thinking about them because it's a headache to think of them. I hope you will forgive, you'll feel much lighter. These are the only three conditions. I would request people sitting on the chairs can remove their shoes and also those who are sitting on the ground, please remove your chairs. [May have meant to say ‘shoes’] Because this Mother Earth helps us a lot, She sucks in our problems. Those who are sitting on the ground are all right, but those who are sitting on the chairs have to put their both the feet on both the sides, because there are two powers, left and right. The left power is the power of ordinary human desire and the right is the power of action. But the Kundalini, which is your Mother, individual Mother, is the power of pure desire. So please have the pure desire in your heart that you should get your realisation. \n",

      "Only thing you should know that there is a Power, all pervading, which exists all around, which thinks, which understands, which coordinates. We do nothing. Human beings have this ego for nothing at all. They really don’t do anything. For example, what do we do is to making a chair. Just a tree is there. We make it into a chair, a dead into a dead. Any living thing do we do? Can we transform a flower into fruit? You can’t. Billions and billions of such things are done every moment on this earth and is done through this divine power of God. We have to feel that, we have to become that. We have to be instruments. God has specially made this instrument in such a way that ultimately you get connected to the whole. Once you get connected you start feeling you’re working on collectivity. Your awareness becomes different; from your hand cool breeze starts flowing and energy starts flowing. And you can feel another person through this cool breeze. You can feel it, what centres there are catching. You can see on the hands we have shown. When these centres are enlightened how these sympathetic centres on our hands, you can feel it and you can find out what’s the matter with another person. What centre is catching, where is the problem, what we have to do. It’s an integration of a person, completely because these, all the centres represent our different beings. When the Kundalini passes through them, She pierces through them just like a thread through many pearls and integrates. But when She enters through this path, then she enters into this awareness, this dynamic awareness of which we become an instrument, which starts flowing, you can feel it. Then as Gregoire has said, he was really very skeptical [unclear], he wanted to find out, he could not believe.\n",

Even if you want you may not get it. It is not that everybody deserves it. So to think that by paying some money or by becoming somebody's disciple or following certain theories you'll achieve it, is all falsehood. The Kundalini is a spontaneous thing. Awakening of it takes place only under certain circumstances. For example, if the seed is not all right, if the soil is not all right, if there is no proper water given to that seed, you cannot see the seed sprouting. But the seed sprouts spontaneously. You cannot pay for it. If the seed is about all right and if the soil is all right the Mother Earth has a capacity to achieve that result.\n",

Now the Zen system came in when Buddha actually Buddha system came in, when Buddha found that in India especially that people had taken too much to worshipping, and dead rituals and all that. The reason was they talked of the, to begin with. They talked of the deities that reside on these chakras. All these deities. Even Christ was described much before he came on this earth.

Of course, you can't give realisation or awakening to people who are stupid, idiotic or who are arrogant.

So this power is built in within you. It's your own power. All of you have got this and for this you don't have to pay.

With what great difficulty this mother earth cradled and brought up us and we are destroying it like this. Have saddened it so much and even after doing that even today that mother earth cradles us even today. Cares for us, looks after us. Even taking that into consideration as well we do not understand that on which path are we digging ourselves. All those who are God's messengers just perceive that these five elements, these are God's messengers, these are their angles ready to help us. It is only we who are ready to cut our neck, what shall God do? Within you there is Kundalini as well and within you, your mother Kundalini is settled there beautifully. It is settled perfectly in three and half circles. Poor [KUNDALINI] is waiting that let the foolish fellows come to the right path. Then your chakras are also beautifully made.\n",

      "Is the spontaneous happening of this living process within you, of sprouting the Kundalini, just like a seed sprouts when you put it in the Mother Earth. You can't pay for it first of all, no you can't. You can't have a course in it − it's not mental, it's something that is inside. Anything that says that by paying you can purchase God or gurus, then know that they're not anywhere near divinity, they have nothing to do with God. Because God doesn't understand money at all, He can only understand love and genuineness within you. So, now, we come to this subtle system that exists within us.\n",

I think, I will sit down and stand up. You stand up here, yes please. You can take out your shoes also, I think. They... First of all, of course as I told you, it acts spontaneously but I will tell you this because you should know, later on, how to raise your Kundalini again and again, which is a very, very simple thing. At the very outset, there are two conditions, of course. The first condition is, that you have to be very self-confident about yourself − that you all can get your realisation and forget your past. There's nothing like sin at this moment, nothing like mistakes at this moment. Whatever has happened, has happened, is finished.\n",

      "We have to have now the last breakthrough of our evolution. Once it happens you will be amazed that we'll know the absolute truth. There cannot be any argument about it. And also, these centres that you know here are a mystery to you, but you start feeling them on your fingertips. That is self-knowledge. These centres are responsible for your physical, mental, emotional, also spiritual being within yourself. So all your personality, the totality of it, expressed through these centres. These are subtle centres within us, and these subtle centres are sometimes exhausted because of our extreme nature. So this power which we call as Kundalini − Kundala means coils, which is in three and a half coils within us in the sacrum bone. That means the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone; they call it sacrum. This power is actually your individual Mother and She knows everything about you. She knows about your past and She knows about your aspirations. It's like a tape recording, I should say, of ages within you in this coiled power. It is like a primule of a seed. When you put the seed in the Mother Earth then it sprouts by itself, spontaneously. That is what is sahaj. Is all built in within you and you have every right to achieve this state of selfhood, which is in the fourth dimension of your awareness, which we in Sanskrit call as 'turiya', is the fourth dimension. All this is within you. All this power is within you. You are built in that way.\n",

      "Now this happening is very simple, spontaneous, works out. As I said, it's like a primule of a seed, this Kundalini. When you put the seed in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself. In the same way, it works. You can't explain. Can you explain how a seed sprouts? In the same way pure primule, which is this Kundalini, uncoils itself and passes through these centres and gives you your Self-Realisation. In Sanskrit is called as Atmashaksatkara. For you it is absolutely granted. You don't have to go to Himalayas. You don't have to stand on your heads. You don't have to starve yourself. Don't have to pay for it. It is all there which is your own power. Only when it happens you realise your identity, you realise how great you are, you realise how the divine is within you and which is expressing Itself.\n",

      "So, first thing we have to do is to respect this Mother Earth. We have to take out our shoes because she sucks in our problems quite a lot. Those who are on the ground also should take out shoes, but they are all right. Now, both the feet are to be kept separately because left and right are two energies, I’ve told you. All right. Now, as I’ve told you, the left represents the power of desire, so you put the left hand towards Me like this, and right hand is to be used for the action of raising the Kundalini. So that later on, even if I’m not there, you can do it properly. Even if you get your Self-Realisation today, your Kundalini might rise, may break through, you might feel the cool breeze, but still, the connection has to be properly fixed. I see many people get it and they get lost. Is the parable of Christ, you see, where ‘some seeds were lost’, it’s something like that. And then they get into troubles, and then they come to Me again. So it’s a waste of time. So you must understand the importance of your life and of your Self-Realisation. First time you’ll have the meaning to your life. And so you have to come to our follow-up meetings and to our centre, which is quite humble. In a humble manner, because it is you who has to get your benevolence. And you don’t have to pay for anything whatsoever. All right?\n",

      "All right. So this is the second condition. And the third one is that you have to know it’s your own power; through your own power you are going to get your Self-Realisation. It doesn’t depend on anyone. It is built in within you. Like in the seed it is built in to sprout and in the Mother Earth it is built in to sprout. So it is spontaneous; it’s a living process. So you should not take any name, any mantras or prayers – nothing is needed just now. And don’t try to concentrate also. The Kundalini itself will manage everything; just leave it alone. With these three conditions, I have to make one request – those who don’t want to have Self-Realisation must leave this hall. In any way I cannot force it on you. You have to ask for it. Christ has said, ‘You have to knock at the door.’ So please those who do not want to have can leave the hall. There is no problem at all for you getting the Realisation. If you don’t forgive – I think many are not forgiving. So please forgive otherwise this [indicating the Agnya chakra] catches very much. Again and again I would say, those who don’t want to have Self-Realisation should leave this hall. All right.\n",

      "It is a living process which has to work out in you that you have to rise in a spontaneous, Sahaj manner. We cannot force it. Like a seed − when you put it in the Mother Earth, it has to sprout spontaneously; the Kundalini which is placed within you has to rise spontaneously. She doesn't understand money, she doesn't understand affluence, she doesn't understand science. She only understands one thing: that he's my child and he has to be given his second birth. And that is your own… − that is your own right to have your second birth, which you should have. And one should not in any way think that we can manage it the way we handle our worldly things. It is Divine, and the Divine has to be managed on Divine level. A light which is the Spirit is not yet shining in your attention. Kundalini is the one which enlightens your attention with the light of the Spirit. Then you become − again I say − you become collectively conscious. Your consciousness takes a new dimension. In Sahaja Yoga it is the becoming that is important. It is not what some people would say, you are a member of this or you have this hierarchy, nothing of the kind. It's what you become is the point. So in the first stage, you become thoughtlessly aware, known as [Nirvichar samadi]. \n",

      "There are two meanings of this illusion or maya. One is brahm in which man becomes brahmak and another is love. We get into illusion because of love. There are these two types of Maya and then there is Lord’s Maya with which he reminds you that you need to achieve something else. You need to search for something else. Your life is mean to discover something else. You are meant to discover the truth. This emotion awakens from the inside and unless your internal desire is not pure until then you cannot achieve that unparalleled state called as Self-Realisation. We say this is our body, our hands, our legs, my car, my house but who is the king of this Me? Who is this me? Ask a doctor who runs this heart? The doctor will reply is an autonomous system. But who is the auto or the self, the doctors do not know. To get the answer to this you have to reach such a state where you know yourself, you have to have self-knowledge. If I tell you that you do not know yourself, you should not feel bad. You may know what colour you like, what food you like but there is system in built in you’re a beautiful complex system consisting of chakras / plexus, nadis / channels a very high state where you get self-awareness (atma-bodh). And that too sahaj meaning saha meaning with and ja means born, so this is born with you. You have the birth right to achieve this Yoga (union with God). And like you sow a seed in Earth, and it sprouts, similarly this Kundalini of yours sprouts because you have the power to get awakened. This Mother Kundalini has the power to sprout this seed. The power of God’s love is all around. You needn’t believe all this (God’s love all around and Me) blindly.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: He wants to know how the Kundalini is raised. As they explained the, yesterday, in German language, that at the base of our spine, there is a power lying there, which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us. And the Spirit lies in the heart which is the reflection of God Almighty. So the power of God is the Holy Ghost, is a female power, because God is a male, then He has a son. There has to be a Mother to the son. They didn't want to have a woman there, imagine. We cannot have women for… They cannot be ordained. This is too much. It's not in India like this, you see. You don't find this kind of a nonsense there but is here that women have accepted, though you are so advanced. There, here it is so stupid that women cannot become priests. Why can't they, if the men can be? So, this, to avoid the women from the whole thing, they called It a Holy Ghost, without telling that it's a female. And that female power is the Shakti which resides in the triangular bone. Now, what happens, that when a person who is authorised, in a way that a person who is a realised soul, is faced by such a person, then the Kundalini spontaneously rises. Just like in the womb of the Mother Earth if you put any seed, spontaneously it sprouts because it's a living process. And it passes through the six chakras. \n",

      "He was an incarnation which was made of, we can say, the, I get sometimes confused with the English language, uh, we can say, with the all-pervading Power, with the Aumkara itself. There was no element of Earth in Him, so He could walk on the water and He could resurrect Himself through this centre and that's why it is said that He's the gate − through Him you have to pass. By doing that, it is, the optic chiasma, in the centre of that it is, it is controlling pituitary and pineal body. Now, when the Kundalini rises and She awakens Christ there, He sucks in these two things which are created by left and right side − one is the ego on the, on that yellow side and the superego on the left-hand side. So, these ego and superego form this kind of a shell for us and we become like an egg, we can say. Sometimes they overlap and then we become very hard shell and we become, what we call, we develop our I-ness. When the Kundalini passes through this Agnya Chakra, then She sucks in, He sucks in, Christ sucks in the left and the right − the conditioning and the karmas and the whole thing goes inside, like that and over the limbic area, with the fontanel bone area, you find like a small child you develop a soft bone again.

      "So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi when Rama came on this earth, first time. And also She incarnated as Radha when Shri Krishna came on this earth. And when She came as Mary, it was Mahalakshmi who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ. So the child She bore was the great personality, of Mahavishnu. This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented, or we can say has an aspect, of others, which incarnated on this earth as two children of Sita. They incarnated as Mahavira and Buddha, as Hassan and Hussein. Also at the time of the prophets Mahalakshmi incarnates as a pure relationship with them. Like Raja Janaka’s daughter was Janaki, means Sita; then She came on this earth as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib; and then She came on this earth as Nanaki, the sister of Nanaka. So She resides as a pure relationship of these gurus. Thus the Mahalakshmi’s greatness is that, through Her power only the Sushumnais cover­ed by Kundalini. She is the power of our evol­ution. And by Her power only we have risen to be human beings and by Her son’s power we are going to become higher people. Thus the impor­tance of Mahalakshmi is very great for all the Sahaja Yogis. Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa to its culmination, to its completion, which is the principle of our evolution. Thus She is a giver of Dharma, She gives us the Dharma and She is the giver of the truth. She is the one who relates us to our brain, the whole brain's system is Mahalakshmi’s system. So it is She who exposes the whole of the knowledge as truth to us, on our central nervous system. \n",

So the first thing is Ganesha. Ganesha is the innocence within you which is very important to be awakened in America. It’s very important. So the first thing we are going to do is the Shri Ganesha’s puja. Innocence. And Ganesha incarnated on Earth as Christ which can be proved also. Through Kundalini awakening we can prove it. So once that happens to you that when your innocence is awakened you’ll be happy to know that most of your diseases that come from the spoiling of this chakra specially. So many diseases that are like that, all these bad diseases are checked. Ganesha is the greatest power you see because he is innocent and the innocence, if it is awakened within you, you’ll become a very powerful person and most of the diseases are sort of cured which are connected with this chakra. So today is not the time to tell you about what the diseases are and how they are checked and all that. All the combinations and permutations of this chakra because other chakras which give you horrible diseases, incurable diseases can be checked and then how to completely cure them for that you have to know the combination of these. When you know the combinations of these then you can check them also completely to get it cured. But at least they do not advance any more. Wherever they are they get completely under check and gradually they go down. But to expedite it you have to understand the complete combination of centres. The chakras, their combinations, then what mantras to be said, how to operate it and everything if you learn it takes hardly any time. Luckily they have offered us another time in this place in the end of October. What is it?\n",

To go further with it, you have seen that picture where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth, and half of it is seen. So, what does this Kundalini do for us? Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?\n",

      "The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection. And what does She do within us to build us up in which way? So, it is the primordial power which is coming out of the Mother Earth. Mother Earth itself acts like a mother. She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want. And another miraculous thing is that the highest tree is a coconut tree and the coconut will never fall on any creature or any human being. That means it’s all-thinking, all understanding, all consciousness, all awareness – is coming from the Mother Earth. But we never understand. As it is, we take it for granted.\n",

      "What is the significance of today’s Angaraki, where special ‘Angarak Chaturthi’ is celebrated? The significance is that Shri Ganesha Himself cools down the ‘Angaar’. [red hot coal] If you see the Kundalini, it is also a type of fire. The mechanism of Kundalini is like flames. Because everything goes towards the Earth; as you know cause of gravity, everything goes towards the Earth. Only this flame moves upwards. Any fire moves upwards and everything else towards the Earth. Upward movement is there only for fire. That is because He can cool down the fire in you. He cools down the fire in two ways. One – He cools the Kundalini. He tells the Kundalini that this person has these problems, but it is all right, you still please make him cross over. Because Kundalini’s child is Shri Ganesha and the child in you is Shri Ganesha, in the same friendliness, He persuades the Kundalini, ‘You are the Mother and I wish that I be awakened in this person. You help Me.’ She becomes cool thinking that, ‘My child is asking this.’ So whatever the heat and problems in us cools down.\n",

It is written in the scriptures that the three and a half Peethas of Goddess exist in Maharashtra. Only the Kundalini has three and a half Peethas. Also there are Ashta Vinayakas that are Shri Ganesha's Swayambhoo idols [come out of Mother Earth], at eight places in Maharashtra. Its veracity cannot be ascertained without realisation since only after the realisation will you know what they are emitting. However at, Musalwadi it is actually the Sahasrara. From this you will know how great is this land and miracles that are going to take place here cannot happen anywhere else. Perhaps you do not know, on this land Shri Macchhindranath a great incarnation of Shri Dattatraya has worked very hard. Before that, sages like Shandilya made this land holy.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: Very difficult, very difficult but they will calm down. I’m sure they will calm down. This is the trouble is that there are all these bhoots around, you allow these bhoots to use your ego, you become, you become [unclear]. Horrible. You are no more, like a bhoot you become, like a monster you start working for them, the whole thing is anti-God, it works out like that. If the ego starts working out the bhoots fly, all the time you see you are taken over. They are called as [Vishatkas??] Is the worst thing to become. So it is a serious thing, I’m sure all your negativity will drop out, all your spirits will drop out, and when you go back I’m sure you can do something great there because you are filled with vibrations and you’ll have to give this to others and try to improve the conditions there. Now those of you who are left-sided have to be very careful than the right-sided because they can see their ego better but the left-sided people think you see all these ideas and this and that, sitting down they think they are meditating, but they are not meditating they give into the left and finishing off. Steady your eyes, to steady your eyes put them on the Mother Earth, and put rose water and the [nectar?] and that in the eyes and also light all the time, those who are left-sided should use as much as possible the lights and things like that. I know you all have got these things in the house and if need be, you can get them from India [unclear]. Not so much the electrical light but the natural light. So candle is nice you can get them all very cheaply in England and put your eyes onto the photograph through that light. I’m sure it will get better, also the backside, even the Kundalini should be raised with light. Try to use the light of the lamp [oil lamp]. How many of you have? But you can buy, very easy to get. You can get it very easy but now they are going away, so those who don’t have if you can leave a list, the people from Bombay, they will get you it. I mean can get it in the market also, they are easy to find.\n",

For that very little has to be done. She rises spontaneously. As if there is some seed. If we want to sprout it, what do we do? You will say, \"Plant it in the Mother Earth\". It's just like that. This is the work of the Mother Earth. It happens spontaneously. \"Saha-ja\", \"Saha\" means born with you. This Kundalini is born with you. And the connection that you get with Her, is your right, it's your birth right. Getting the connection established is your birth right. That you should take.

      "There is no self-esteem in a human being. There’s no self-esteem, he doesn’t understand what is his value. Why is he on earth? Is he here just to roam about and waste his life and die like an animal? Or there is something, a purpose within him? He doesn’t recognise it. Just now, on the way I was telling him that I don’t know about Chiswick because we have had thirty people last time, on whom I worked very hard, and none of them turned up. I said I don’t know what type of people live in Chiswick. I really told – just now, while coming with him I said that I don’t know if they have any self-esteem. I don’t know why. So far I have not met people who have self-esteem, who want to have it, but because Patricia said I said, ‘All right, I’ll come along.’ Let’s see today what happens but I have to tell you again and again, whether you belong to Chiswick or anything, you are human beings and you are created by God in a flower. And He loves you very much. He is anxious to do this for you, no doubt. But He is not going to fall at your feet that, ‘Please take your realisation.’ You have to get it. You have to not only get it but you have to establish it and there is a protocol about it. If you go there like a BBC interviewer, say Robin Day style, he said, ‘All right, thank you very much.’ The attention immediately receives from that point. One has to understand that the time has come for the Last Judgment. This is the Last Judgment. Only the Kundalini awakening is the way you are going to be judged, there’s no other way. How God is going to judge you? Just tell me. Only way is by giving you awakening. I’ve seen how it works out. \n",

Everybody has this fundamental, very fundamental right to get this yoga, means the union with the divine. All of you have this fundamental right. You may not be aware of it, you may not be knowing it, but that's a fact, and you can't pay for it. That's one thing we should realise. That it is a living process, say, we have become human beings, what did we pay? What did we do? We just became. To become the higher personality what do we have to do? The problem is, we don't understand that you cannot pay for your evolution, which is a living process. How much do we give to this Mother Earth for creating such beautiful flowers? Different types of flowers. What do we do, do we stand on our heads or anything? She gives because that is her nature, to give, she's made like that. In the same way you are made, as they have told you here, with all these centres. These centres are there and they exist in every human being. Now the greatest point is that this power, which we call as Kundalini, which resides in the triangular bone, of sacrum, is in every human being. It's something very surprising. I mean every human being has a heart, every human being has eyes, nose, everything. But this power, which is a spiritual power, exists in every person. Whether you are black, white, brown, or also any religion you follow or whatever you may do, it exists. We cannot differentiate human beings. On a spiritual level, we'll understand that we cannot differentiate. It's a myth, to differentiate.\n",

If you want it only then it will work out. But first of all, you must know that you are a human being and you must respect yourself. You must have love for yourself, it's not selfishness but respect that you are a human being and here you have come to get your Self-Realisation. That's something very special. There are so many people in New York but you are special that have come for your Self-Realisation. If you have only this feeling within yourself, without any force it will work out, I'm sure. Now, you don't have to do anything, but if you could take out your shoes it will be better because this Mother Earth helps us. I hope you don't mind taking out shoes. That will definitely help, because your connection with the Mother Earth is very important. You will then realise how important is this Mother Earth, how she helps us in our spiritual life. So far we have never known it's important.\n",

As the tree was growing, the tree of life, he talked about the tree of life, tree of fire, about Kundalini – he did talk. But he more talked about the sustenance, about the maintenance of the balance of the being. He was more particular on that point because that was the time when people had to learn to be in a balance. He didn’t talk of baptism, for example, Jews don’t believe in baptism. But he did say that somebody is going to come – Masiha [Messiah] – and He is going to give you the Spirit. He is going to give you the realisation. But Jews, as you know, denied Christ, they didn’t believe in Him, and that’s how Christ was crucified.\n",

Apart from other advents, first of all, I’ll tell you about Christ, how important He is and how He plays a very important role in the human beings. People just talk of Christ, Christ, Christ… We should go to the church, say ‘Christ’, ‘Jesus Christ is the one I see’… So many posters saying ‘Jesus Christ is within you’, ‘Jesus Christ is coming’, ‘Jesus Christ is here’ – but where? Where is He? Where does He reside within us? He resides in the centre which is the sixth centre called as Agnya. This centre is placed between the pituitary and pineal body, is a very subtle centre and has got two sub-plexuses. He incarnates there as the embodiment of innocence. That’s why He is such a powerful deity who incarnates and settles down in that area. His coming on this earth was very important because the ego and superego had crossed each other and there was no space for the Kundalini to pass through. That is the cross where He was crucified.\n",

      "But Jesus Christ Himself, He came on this earth because we had a problem – the problem was of ego. The problem was, whatever work we did, whatever bad things we did created an institution of sin. We became sinners within; that made us a personality which was sinning. And He came on this earth to suck all the sins from us. It is all promised in the ancient scriptures that such and such personality will be coming and when He comes, He is awakened by the Kundalini, and if He will be awakened in the Kundalini, then He will suck your sins. So there will be no karmas, there will be no sin, not at all. So He came on this earth for sucking our sins, to take our sins; He died for our sins, we all say this. Then why do you have the idea of sin anymore? Why do you go and confess about your sins? Because if Christ is there and if He is awakened, He will definitely suck our sins.\n",

So I would suggest that you put your left-hand, which is the power of desire, towards me throughout and with the right-hand will do few actions of placing the hands on different centres. First of all, don’t close your eyes, I just tell you and explain to you and then you can see for yourself what is to be done because your eyes will be closed.

      "Today is the day of great happiness and joy and that we have to know that Christ came on this earth to deliver us from our sins and our karmas and it was such a sacrifice. He went into which he cannot see or visualise with human understanding. It was too much for a person who was so powerful to get into a position where he had to forget that he was so powerful and go through all that and treated just like an ordinary person. It was too much but he did it just because that drama was to be played because Agnya Chakra was to be opened up. But we have to understand that though he has done all that, our karmas are being taken away as you know that as soon as the Kundalini is awaken, you know that Kundalini cannot be awakened if your karmas are [not] clean. You cannot, that’s why in the olden days people used to go to Himalayas and all those farfetched places where they used to clean their karmas clean their bodies clean everything and then they used to get awakening of the Kundalini {then to get their realisation}. But the way we have got realisation thanks to Christ that Agnya Chakra could be opened out and that I could manage that. But we do not realise that once that is done that means you are now entitled to get your realisation because of your Agnya Chakra being opened out that your Sahasrara can be opened out. But, the punishment of the karmas has been taken away. You have been given such a higher position that you suddenly become Saints and you get all the knowledge that Saints cannot have about Sahaja Yoga, about the Shudh Vidya the Nirmal Vidya, you get all the knowledge of the Spirit. But the problem is I find that we have certain special problems belonging to the special countries also and my attention has been on England very much, you know that and I have really worked here very hard, ten years I have worked. And for English Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand what are they lacking in just a our own understanding of ourselves which should be done with proper critical eye so that we understand what is our problem.\n",

There have been many seers in this great country of yoga also as I told you yesterday that I was amazed that 2000 years back a gentleman called Kaka Bhujang had written in detail that Sahaja Yoga will be started, that Manvantara will take place, that human beings will go into the transformation from 1970s. That the Kundalini which is in a sleeping state in human beings will arise without any difficulty, people will not have to take to bhakti and gyana and Patanjali yoga, that is, devotion and to Gyan yoga and to this Patanjali yoga which you know that Patanjali has written but there will be someone who will be able to raise the Kundalini without any difficulty. It is so remarkable the whole thing the description is that I was amazed how he could see these things so clearly, as also William Blake has surprised Me completely and absolutely I am aghast to the details, the way he has described everything, every detail of My movement in England. These definitely help you to understand that the time has come to change. Also, we have to see the signs of some new transformation on this Earth. The Nal Damayanti Purana has described that in the Kali Yuga, those people who are seeking God in the hills and dales will settle down as householders and they will be blessed with them, their Self-Realisation. \n",

      "Though Markandeya has described Kundalini, the different powers of the Mother, but it was Adi Shankaracharya who came to this Earth, and he is the one who talked of Kundalini openly. The reason was, before this, it was kept secret and part of it was revealed and people used to doubt, or if it was to be revealed whom to reveal it? Because there were very few people who were capable of knowing about it. In the Bible it is written that there will be a tree of life, and this tree of life is nothing but the whole Sushumna Nadi and its branches. Also, written that, ‘I will appear before you like tongues of flames.’ What are these things? Tongues of flames are, if you see, your Sahasrara. I do not know how many of you have seen your Sahasrara, it looks like thousand tongues of flames. We call them petals. It's more beautiful to call them petals, but they are flames. When they are awakened they look like flames, very silent flames, burning. And when this Sahasrara you see, when you see the beauty of the Sahasrara, you are amazed that to a gross mind this brain is nothing but the fat cells put together. But when you get your realisation then you find that the same thing that looks like just a group of fat cells and these nerves, as elongated fat cells you can call them, when they are enlightened, you see the light around them and they are like enlightened wicks of a candle. Very long burning flames, beautiful, in different colours, very silent, very beautiful. \n",

      "But I was amazed you see where Kabira lived and worked, in that Bihar, where he has used the word surathi for Kundalini, is used for tobacco [Laughter]. Yes! Surathi means Kundalini, the purity, the virginity within you. He writes the stat surathi, description of the Kundalini as we see in Sahaja Yoga, and they call surathi as tobacco. But this is really what we have done out of them. Believe me. We are so absurd that it is better that all of you who are My children find the Spirit, find the Truth and then relate your religion to that Truth and don't get entangled with all the funny ideas and all the limited ideas and all the dead ideas which are clinging on to the Truth. And like the Sun is overshadowed by these clouds you better get your eyes to see the Sun, and if you are really that, if you are a real Hindu, a real Christian, a real Sikh, get your Spirit and bring out all your people who are lost in the ignorance. Today is a great day, again I say, of the Spirit being manifested on this Mother Earth and we have to today vow that we will also manifest our Spirit on this Earth. You have to get that Spirit awakened and once it is awakened [unclear] like that is the power of Spirit. \n",

      "Shri Mataji: Goes to the lunatic asylums also, wants to be with the rogues and wants to be with this, wants to be with that, all that. You see, such a person can be also in torture. But that is the path, the path of Kundalini could be in trouble, could be. But Kundalini is not that way. Of course, sometimes She is so hurt, I have seen Her being very much hurt, passing through that path She feels so hurt. But that’s a different point. Now this Kundalini is there, just matured, sitting down there, waiting for a moment to rise. Now what happens, when people who are not authorised by divine Power of God, who are not holy people – we should put it straight forward, who are not really holy people but just are unholy people, or you can put any strong word you want – ‘hypocrites’ or anything. If they try any tricks with the Kundalini then there’s a deity sitting on the first centre, He hits them hard! And that hitting can cause big problems, like people can develop blisters. Not the Kundalini, She is extremely kind, She is your Mother, She is not going to do any harm. But this deity which is the deity embodying your innocence, it can’t bear any wrong entry to the Mother, so that deity gets angry and you get problems of the sympathetic nervous system. And such people have so many problems. They can have blisters on the body, even cancer! Because these people have no authority, they cannot awaken it. They cannot awaken it. For example, if you put a seed under a hot blanket, will it prosper? It will die out. It has to be the Mother Earth. In the same way the one who is authorised to do the Kundalini awakening has to do it. Anybody who tries otherwise then He harms the person. And can be very harmful. \n",

We are here on this earth, like this instrument if you make, you’ll ask, “Mother why are you making this instrument?” This instrument is made to carry My voice. In the same way you, the human beings are made instruments of God. Now you are to be employed by God and He’s going to use you and this power is going to flow through you.

      "Yes, must be, because the people who raise have no authority to do it; they don’t know how to do it. A person who is not a doctor if he tries to operate, what will happen? It’s dangerous. So far so many people their Kundalini has been awakened. I haven’t seen any dangerous things happen to anyone, on the contrary everybody has gained by it. The reason is you should know how to do it, you should be an authority to do it. Supposing you put one seed in the steel box, will it grow? No, you have to put it in the Mother Earth, she has the capacity to do it. In the same way the one who knows can do it, has to be an authority on it, and it is your Mother, She is your Mother. Everyone has an individual mother waiting to give that Self-Realisation, how can She be unkind to you? Of course, in the beginning little heat is thrown out of your body because you’re heated up. It’s all right, doesn’t matter, it’s not so much and sometimes you do feel little shaking if you have been to a wrong type of a guru or something or if you are suffering from nervous trouble there’s a little shaking that's all. I have not seen anything wrong happening but like one gentleman came and sat on the ground. I said, “Why are you sitting on the ground like that with your feet towards me?” He said, “You know Mother, my Kundalini has been awakened and I’m jumping like a frog.” I said, “Why are you jumping like a frog?” He said, “My guru has said it and he wrote it down on a book that you jump like a frog.” I said, “Now are you going to become a frog or an earthworm?” Use your brains, all right? Nothing to be afraid of. I don’t think I look that frightful, do I?\n",

What is the purpose? So many of you got realisation last time, but you are nowhere, you've done nothing. I mean, you've got your realisation, all right. Each person can give realisation to thousands of people if he gets out of his own, I should say, own ideas. And this can do such a lot of good to the whole world. Formerly, in America it was terrible, because all kinds of funny people went there, to make money. So, they told Me: ‘If you don't ask for money, Mother, in America nobody will come. They have to pay for it, otherwise they don't value it.’ I said, ‘But, sorry, you cannot, how much, you tell Me how much should I charge. How much do you charge for your Mother's love? Then you tell Me how much you charge and then we can work it out.’ And it was surprising that it hit their heads. Now it's better.

      "The guilt business that many people have, “I am guilty,” that has to be given up. If you think you are guilty then it’s rather difficult because of the left-hand side of this Vishuddhi chakra catches very badly in those people who think that they are guilty for something. I mean it’s a fashion in the West to feel guilty, is a very common fashion. In India I have not seen anybody who knows about it and when I tell them they are quite surprised.” What is there to feel guilty? We are not in the jail. Why should we feel guilty?” This kind of feeling that we are nurturing also blocks your realisation and always sucks in your energy there. As the Kundalini is your Mother and She is one like Mother Earth, like the Aquarius, like the Aquarian Age. This is the age of Kundalini. It’s called as Kumbha in Sanskrit language. She represents that and the Kundalini when She comes up, She nourishes you and in that nourishment, She looks after your attention. She fills up the attention with Her energy which gets ignited by the entry of the Spirit into your attention.\n",

      "That will of God is the Holy Ghost, that is the Primordial Mother. There has to be a mother if there’s a father and a son, isn’t it? Now, this Primordial Mother is reflected within us as Kundalini and She awakens spontaneously. It is a living process, of a living power. And whatever living happens is always spontaneous. Supposing, you want to sprout a seed, you just have to put it in the Mother Earth, and spontaneously it sprouts. Because the Mother Earth has the capacity and the seed has the possibility. So, it manifests spontaneously. You don’t have to pay anything, you don’t have to stand on your head, you don’t have to wear any badges, you don’t have to believe into anything, it just happens. In the same way, awakening of the Kundalini takes place. It is a living process. It pierces through six centres…not the seventh one is lower. And ultimately pierces through your fontanel bone area. And you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head. You feel it. Nobody has to certify you; you yourself feel a cool breeze coming out of your own head. This is the real baptism. This is the living baptism. It is not some priest putting some water on your head, and saying: “Now you are baptized.” It is a myth. It’s a reality. So, then, after some time, or in some people at the same moment, you start feeling the All-Pervading Power. On your central nervous system, on your fingertips. In English if you say: “It is on your fingertips”, means: very innate, it is very innate.\n",

So, please, you should not blame Me if it does not work out. I’ll work hard, and you have to be patient with yourself. And have to respect yourself. Because, you are the Temple of God. Now, questions. Shri Mataji: [What’d he say?] Translator: “Does realisation give us an obligation towards you?” Shri Mataji: “Me? What can you give Me?” People: “Nothing!” Shri Mataji: “That’s it! That is the obligation, nothing! Do you know how much we are blessed, do you know without the sun we cannot exist for a second? What do we give to the sun? What do we give to this Mother Earth? She gives because that is Her nature.”\n",

So, this is what one has to understand, that once you get to the subtleties of the fire, so the fire and the water both of them become sort of Divine. For example, the water which you touch, water you drink, whatever you put your hand in the water, the water becomes vibrated. Means What? The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness, curing power also comes in that water. So, when it becomes subtler, all these powers start showing which you can see for yourself. You do not have to experiment. Then the lastly is the Mother Earth, is most important is Mother Earth. There is a photograph you might see which was taken in Russia in My Dacha where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth. They have shown clearly. It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows. For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep them in My room, they blossom. They can become very big like that, never people have seen such big flowers, sometimes they say. I am doing nothing. I am just sitting down and what happens to the flowers? You see now, there this principle of the Mother Earth works… the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it’s a mother. And that gives you all the nourishment and makes you grow healthy, and this is how this subtlety of the Mother Earth works.\n",

      "The Kundalini also, which people know about, because Markandeya has talked about it, though it was a good [unclear] for lots of things, as you have got Suchindra, Suchindra because Indra got His Realisation. But He did not give up His position as Indra, only thing in Antar Yoga, He got realisation. So this realisation has to work out within ourselves, not without, because it is a living process; this also we don’t understand that we have become human beings out of amoeba stage through a living process. Now the living process is the simplest of all, cannot be difficult; say for example, if you want to sprout a seed, you don’t go to university to read about it, you just plant it in the Mother Earth, and it sprouts, it is built-in; because the whole thing is built-in within yourself, you have to just start it. It is like a car which is presented to you, absolutely first class, you have to just enlighten it. What is so difficult, you need not to know all the parts of the car, or you need not to know all the theory about it. In the same way, supposing you have to put on the light, you just say ‘press the button’, and the light is on. You need not to know all that headache, you need not, it’s all done! It’s so simplest done. But then if you want to repair that light, then you might need it, and it’s much easier once you have got the light within yourself to see.\n",

      "As a result of that, once you get realisation, what happens? These centres that we have got within us, six centres through which the Kundalini pierces through and the one centre which is below that, are responsible, on the gross physical sense, for all your working. So, they work on the gross self and you get your diseases cured. Today only there was a lady with us, she has got cancer and all her glands were swollen from here to here [Shri Mataji shows the right side of Her neck]. And she was so shy of that, that she was covering her head and sitting like this. So she sat down next to Me, I asked her ‘just put your left hand towards me and right hand towards the Mother Earth; the Mother Earth will take the problem.’ Just that. After, say 15 minutes or so, I asked her ‘how are you feeling?’ She said: ‘I don’t know how I am feeling’. I said: ‘all right, remove all her covering’. All the glands have vanished into thin air. Then you might say: ‘Mother, how it has happened?’ We can explain to you, we can tell you, how it has happened, you cannot [unclear]. But first and foremost thing is to get to your Atma Sakshatkara (Self-Realisation), to your Atmo Buddha, that’s the first thing. That’s why Buddha didn’t talk about God, they say He was a Nirishwara, but not that, because He thought if you talk of God, then people just think ‘oh, to going to God is the best way, so let’s just start doing all other things but Atma Sakshat’. So, He said you must get your Self-Realisation. You must get your Atmo Buddha. Without that, you are not complete. \n",

As you know in Markandeyas book, He is described as Maha Vishnu. They all have talked about Him and He has come on this Earth. In Hindi to support the adhar, to hold him. Because He is from the very beginning. As Ganesha is adhara and as Christ also is adhara. But what you have done of Him, His spirit, His intellect. So give anything to human beings and they'll make up a laugh of it. Just think the brain is like that. I don't know how it can do it to Him. It is another crucifixion every moment I feel it the way people have done it. In you He resides, awaken Him within you, and become the spirit, because He was the spirit and you can become the spirit. Everything that has happened before has to be proved today. Everything that is said about sustenance and all that is to be proved. Moses has to be proved, Socrates has to be proved, Abraham has to be proved, everyone has to be proved, but this is not necessary. Why should anybody prove them? Only in realisation you in yourself you have to accept, because not taking Their name the Kundalini won't rise. They are true to Kundalini. She proves. She proves it to you, that They all were absolutely true people and They want you to receive the truth. She is within you. She is the sensible part within you. She is the wisdom within you. She is the one who looks after you [unclear]and She is the one who keeps you on the right path. To such a Kundalini we bow and we have our Realisation. May God bless you. \n",

Like if you want to sow a seed in the Mother earth it sprouts by itself. You don’t pay to the mother earth. She has a built-in quality to sprout and the seed has a built-in quality to sprout. So why should you pay for these things? All these things in the name of God also, in the name of religion. They are either power oriented or they are money oriented. None of them are Spirit oriented. First, you must see the disciples and see what they have got it. And then judge it.\n",

Now the right-hand towards me and the left-hand towards the Mother Earth [actually sky as per video]. Now, don't think. See what we are doing that we are allowing the vibrations to come this way and everything that is caught up in the right-hand is going to the ether, is going to the sky. The five elements. Now I’ll tell you have to give protection to yourself and how to raise the Kundalini and then you see for yourself how it works out. At [unclear] you all can do it yourself. Put the left-hand towards me like this. Now to protect our aura, you have to put your right-hand, because the energy is flowing through your right-hand, every bodies hand its flowing. You feel it or not is not the point. Its flowing and you will feel it. Because of this [Vishuddhi] centre sometimes, if people smoke a lot, sometimes you don't feel it. So it doesn't matter. You feel it. Before going out of your house you should do this and sleeping time you should do this, to protect yourself. Now you have to give protection to your aura like this. \n",

Now how to raise the Kundalini. You can raise your own Kundalini. When you feel little disturbed you give yourself a Bandhan, what we call this kind of protection and raise your Kundalini. How do you raise it. Just you put the left-hand towards the Kundalini, put the right-hand on top and you have to move the hand in such a way upward, downward, lower; like a clockwise. Now watch your left-hand. Now raise your left-hand like this. Now let's go. Watch the left-hand with concentration. Now push back your head and loosen your shoulders and give it a twist, now give it a knot. Bring it down again. Let us do it carefully. Watch your hand. Watch your hand, push back your shoulder and again twist. Now you have to give three knots last time. Watch your hand. Now one twist and give knot, the second twist and give knot, and the third twist and give knot for three powers. Now see your hands. All right. Feeling it. It is good. On top of your head. If you are not feeling on top of your head, you just say “mother come in my head”. Say it seven times. Kundalini is your mother. just say “mother come in my head”. Say it seven times. All right. Good. She is your mother. She is so kind. Not in the left? All right, put the left towards me and right towards the Mother Earth.\n",

When the power of god spread all around Which we call as ‘Ruh’ - is felt then we should say the transformation has happened… And this is a lively process… If you put a seed in the mother's abdomen, then it grows. The seed gets sprouted… No need to stand on her head… The earth is itself so powerful and there is the power in the seed as well… that it get sprouted. For that, no special efforts have to be done. By this way, you also have this power… That power is sitting there, Whether you are of any religion or country, Whatever may be your colour… It is residing in all human beings… It is not that much on animals… Like nowadays it is popular ‘Save animals and kill humans’. This power is inside human beings… gets enriched completely… It is also there on animals but not that much prosperous. This is the speciality of human being that it is prosperous in them… And in that prosperity, if there is any known or learned person then the Kundalini gets awakened.

      "The past is finished and the future doesn't exist, so why not get it in the present moment. Because we cannot live in the present moment with the temperant life, we get into troubles physical, mental, emotional, uh… material, economic, political all kinds. So, how to come to the centre? The Kundalini goes through your centres and brings you in one line. She integrates you but this knowledge is difficult to digest. One of the reasons is, I'm living. When I will be dead, then you might build temples for Me. But just now in your time, I'm telling you then you won't accept, you won't try to understand and learn. This is human nature and this is the reason why all the people, who came on this earth, could not give realisation to anyone of them. Even the Christ disciples felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost when He was dead.\n",

Now, put both the feet on the Mother Earth so the Mother Earth sucks in the left and right-side problems within us. Automatically she sucks in when we start feeling the All-Pervading [power] So, the first thing that happens to you, that when the Kundalini crosses this centre, you become absolutely peaceful, without thoughts. You become thoughtlessly aware. That means, at this centre ego and the superego, the conditioning, is sucked in. You can think, if you want to but no thoughts can invade you. Then you feel the cool breeze emitting out of your own head which you have to feel yourself. You have to give yourself a certificate. You have to be convinced about yourself.\n",

      "Now, very simple things are to be done. As I said it is effortless. You cannot pay for it, is effortless, is a living process. Just like a seed being sprouted by the Mother Earth your Kundalini gets sprouted. You don't have to do anything about it, but a little help is to be rendered because as I said, there are certain problems in people. Now for that one thing we have to take help as far as possible from the different elements. One of them the most important is the Mother element, Mother that is this Mother Earth, and we have to take help from Her. You'll be surprised that the sacrum bone which is the abode of the Kundalini is made from the essences of the Mother Earth. So that is of great help to us that we should take the full help of those essences. For that we have to take out our shoes, we need not to take out our socks, but shoes, and put your feet on the Mother Earth. Just to take out your shoes. All of you should do it. Please, it's very simple, and put your feet on the Mother Earth. All these will take hardly ten to fifteen minutes. But please don't move away at that time because everybody will be disturbed. Nothing is going to go wrong, nobody is going to be harmed, there is going to be no trouble for you at all. You have to be little patient with yourself and also have respect for yourself. It will just work out without any difficulty, I assure you. Only thing is that little bit cooperate and don't get up in the middle with your ego suddenly standing up or something because you'll disturb others. It's not civil. It is uncivil to disturb people who are meditating. You are now in the mood of entering into the Kingdom of God. So keep that respect and that protocol that we have to do as we are entering in the Kingdom of God. Another request is that if you have anything tied, here or here, just loosen it because it does make a little discomfort to you. If there is any discomfort felt, then, otherwise it's all right. If you are comfortable, I've nothing to say. Because if… you should be comfortable your attention should not be drawn to any discomfort. You can take out your coats if you find it hot or in any way uncomfortable. You better be prepared for that. That there should be nothing that should distract your mind outside.\n",

He had cancer of his stomach. A staunch Muslim. And I told him, because of you are a staunch fanatic, got the cancer of stomach. He couldn’t believe, but his wife has been said. So I said – you have to believe that Mohammed Sahib took many incarnations before and afterwards and that you cannot say that Mohammed Sahib is the only one who came on this Earth and he is the last God on this Earth − it’s wrong. Because He himself has talked about the future. And who is going to do the future work if He is the last one and what about the future work, talk Resurrection Day, this, that? Who is going to do that? He couldn’t accept it. I said, ‘Will you accept that He was Nanaka? Born as Nanaka?’ He said, ‘I don’t accept it.’ I said, ‘All right, I can’t help you, I am sorry.’ So went back. He went to his hotel and all that. He tried all the doctors and they said that you give up, we cannot cure you. So his wife said, ‘Mother, could you save it?’ So he came back to Me. I said, ‘Now do accept?’ ‘Yes, and if you say Mother.’ ‘I won’t tell you lies isn’t it?’ He said, ‘Of course You won’t tell us lies.’ I said, ‘You do better accept it,’ and all right, accepted it.

When this residual force as Kundalini, which people must have explained to you, from that sacred bone of sacrum rises and pierces through all these centres, it enlightens all of them one by one.

Once you become that absolute, the Absolute, then all relativity drops out. We actually live in a relative world which is false, which is not true. This power has its own telecommunication.

It is said in all the scriptures that you are a Spirit but you have to be born again. So there is something that is lacking in this human life, in this human awareness. And this human awareness has to be enlightened by the light of the Spirit. But how to do it? We think that by reading, by talking about it, by thinking about it, or by crying for God, or worshipping God, we can get it. It’s wrong. It’s a living process. Just like a seed sprouting. Just like a primule coming out of the seed in a living way. In the same way there is a Kundalini within us, a power, a residual power, which is actually our primal desire, the power of primal desire which manifests this happening. She’s sleeping there till somebody who is the authority or has a capacity to awaken it. Like the Mother Earth has got the capacity to awaken the primule in a seed. Nobody can do it.

You are still worried about your father, mother, brother, sister, wife, children. Open your heart fully, to Sahaj Yoga, in a doubtless way. Then only doubtless awareness will settle down. Unless and until you open your heart, Kundalini rising has no meaning. Because Kundalini is rising but the heart has not opened.

Now we have seen many-a-times that the Ashta Vinayaka [Eight Ganesha] that is there in Maharashtra, the Ashta Vinayaka is there. How do we know that the Ashta Vinayaka is true? How will you prove that the Ashta Vinayaka came out of the Earth? This needs some kind of proof. Just that ‘My father told, my father’s parents told,’ even if this is true, our children will not agree to this. All religions also requires proof and today’s Sahaja Yoga has become Maha Yoga because you can prove everything in it.\n",

      "As Mr. Subramaniam has told you, that this is just the beginning. It's the awakening of the Kundalini and breaking the Sahasrara, just the beginning. Yes, it's true, just like a seed is sprouted by the touch of Mother Earth, you are receiving your Self-Realisation, your second birth, and you feel beautiful after that; but then you get lost, you just get lost, and then I think of the parable of Christ that some seed fell here, some seed fell there, and most of them were lost. So the second part of it, that as human beings you have to know what you are, you must evaluate yourself. You must know you have not come on this Earth to gather some money and die, and leave some for your children to get spoilt. But you are here to get that eternal life. For that you have to work the whole thing out, understand about yourself, understand about your roots, what you are. \n",

      "I should say is the job of a Sahaj Yogi or your Divine Mother, but afterwards to learn the yukti, the kaushalyam, the kushalta, the deftness, how to develop this awareness into that stillness, and this awareness into that higher awareness which you call it vibratory awareness. How to station it there is the job of an awakened soul. So we have two different functions to do; first is to awaken the Kundalini. That, I know, sometimes can be difficult, can be easy depending on the sadhaka, on the seeker, but the other part of it becomes much easier for a person who is awakened if he has real bhakti for himself, real understanding that he is a person of some value. He has come on this Earth, not to just waste his precious human life and fritter it away, but for a very, very special purpose. All such people will dedicate themselves completely to master the art of yoga.\n",

      "The last is now the Sahasrara; at this point the human beings have got all other centres properly developed. Even the Sahasrara is developed and what you have to do is to just make the connection with the Divine. Now the connecting line also is there, the Kundalini in three and half coils settled in the triangular bone. This connection has to be brought out of your head, which breaks through and you start feeling this new awareness of collective consciousness. This is how the process takes place. It's a very simple process of like just like sprouting the seed. But as you cannot sprout a seed by just dancing about it or singing about it or reading books about it, it has to go to the Mother Earth. In the same way, somebody who has the capacity, who has that love, who has that understanding of the Kundalini, has to do the job. And once it is done, it's like one light enlightens another light. The another light has to steady itself first of all, know how to enlighten another light and start doing it. That's how the work is going to move in the new direction of new awareness, which we call as chaitanya maya chetna or enlightened awareness or vibratory awareness. \n",

      "By the grace of God you are sitting in the land of yoga. Very great saints have been here. Their feet have touched this land, this is the land of yoga, howsoever much it is described, it still falls short. Yesterday, I don't know how many times I stopped Myself from describing it, didn't know how to describe. The Kundalini of the whole universe is sitting here, in Maharashtra. There are three-and-a-half peethas, many people say that. If there are three-and-a-half peethas, what does it mean? It means that the three-and-a-half peethas of the Kundalini of the whole universe are in Maharashtra. Ashta Vinayak are in Maharashtra, they've surrounded from all eight sides, made arrangements for purity. Ashta Vinayak and three-and-a-half peethas are in it, twenty eight places of the Devi, everything has been arranged by the Mother Earth.\n",

Let us see. One day we should not touch Mother’s feet. Doesn’t matter. You all can touch from there, and there is a way of collectively touching Mother’s feet is the way we do always. You can all do it just now, but we need not actually touch, but you are actually touching. Even touching the Mother Earth you are touching. Just touch the Mother Earth and you are there. Just touch the Mother Earth; you will find the Kundalini rising.

      "You cannot say if this deity has come out of the Mother Earth or not. Also, you cannot say about any person, who is your relation, whether he is a good relation or a bad relation, or what sort of a person he is, whether he goes to wrong people or to the right people, whether he has connections with wrong side or with good side. Here good means Divine. So, actually, you do not know anything about divinity with your mind, nothing. Nothing – is impossible for you to judge a person about his divinity unless and until the Kundalini reaches at least this part, which is the limbic area. You cannot make out whether a person is real or not, whether a guru is real or not. Because divinity cannot be perceived through your brain, unless and until this light of your Spirit shines into it. Now, the Spirit is expressed in the heart, is reflected in the heart; the centre of the Spirit, we can say, is in the heart. But actually the seat of Spirit is above, here.

      "At the Agnya level, they may sometimes develop a headache with people who are very much caught up on the Agnya, on the right side. It is important at this time to give a bandhan to yourself and to the other person who is very egoistical, and don't listen to them. Just close your ears and the person will stop talking. Also they might develop some pressures on both the sides of the head. Sometimes when the Kundalini cannot rush upward, there is an obstruction on the Agnya, then you might feel the pressure on this brain plate. At that time they should try to bring the grace on top of all the sympathetic systems, bring it down, could stand on Mother Earth. Ask Her to suck it. So the Kundalini's pressure is reduced, because when the grace comes on the body, then all the chakras open up and also Agnya opens up. If they have problem with their Agnya they should use a candle at the back, if their eyesight is getting weak or short sighted. If their Agnya is too much here [front] there are mantras which are to be used like, ‘I forgive every one,’ and all that. On the subtler way, you know all the mantras that are to be said.\n",

      "But in every day-to-day life I find human beings are always saying, ‘I think, I think, I think.’ All the time giving alternatives and that’s why they go up and down, up and down, up and down like that. But for fire, or for water, or for Mother Earth, there is no alternative, there is no alternative. If I just touch the Mother Earth and I say, ‘Suck in their problems please!’ She sucks in. If I tell the fire, ‘Now come along, you have been ignited!’ I don’t even tell! I don’t even tell. They immediately suck in. Their Kundalini rises, you can say. [If] you put a fire in front of My photograph – it’s vibrated. You put a light – it’s vibrated. It has no alternatives. It doesn’t think. It has no alternatives. It’s just enlightened. It has its own quality of enlightenment, in the purest sense. Because thinking makes it impure. Your enlightenment becomes impure by your thinking, by giving explanations, by giving all these nonsensical alternatives. \n",

      "But when such a swayambu thing comes out, you can’t understand why people are attracted to it. So then you become in charge of that thing. Then you want to make artificial images of that. It’s human nature, to make everything that you see real, make it artificial. And that goes on and on and on, till human beings themselves become so identified with their artificiality that they don’t understand what reality is! In reality, whatever you are, you are the highest. You are the highest epitome of all the creation. Even the thing that comes out of the Mother Earth cannot do the work that you can do. It cannot raise the Kundalini, it cannot cure; maybe a little bit of effects might be there, but it won’t work out with that force, with that manoeuvring. I mean, you are like a very advanced machinery of God’s work: very advanced, extremely sharp, and extremely effective. But the problem is this brain of yours, when it comes in between — which is nothing compared to that big brain.\n",

      "Now what He said by the second birth or by baptism was that this Kundalini, which is lying at the triangular bone there, has to rise. Rise and penetrate through this centre, awaken Jesus Christ there. Now the… what great miraculous thing He has done, that once you awaken this centre within us, these two institutions on the left and the right, one is the ego another is the superego. One is the ego which gives us all ideas about ourselves, which are not really self-esteem but something false, and superego – is the condition in which we human beings become conditioned in which we accept conditions: ‘I am this, I am this, I am this.’ Both the things are sucked in by the awakening of the Kundalini of this great incarnation on this Earth. Once it is sucked in, what you find, that on top of your head where you reach this place, you find that it has become an open space now and suddenly you find the Kundalini’s rising and you can feel the breeze of the Holy Ghost.\n",

      "There was a book called Nadi Granth, written, you can't say how many years back, but was revised only three hundred years back by another person called Bhujander. Now this Nadi Granth is written by a person who is actually the starting point of astrology in India, the one who started. The whole astrology has been started from India and this is the man, Bhrigu, who did it. And he wrote this Nadi Granth, in which he has described − according to him, he said it in Sanskrit language but was again translated and brought to up to date level − that in 1970, something will happen, a personality will come on this Earth who will give realisation to thousands of people by a sahaja method. It's clearly written down, you'll be amazed to know that it is so, because we have a book; in that book all these prophecies are written. And what will happen? The Kundalini will rise and people will get their realisation.\n",

      "Now, how it can happen in a person is a problem. It used to happen. What knowledge I am telling you is not the knowledge of today. Is the knowledge of very, very ancient times. Fourteen thousand years back, Markandeya, a great poet in India, has written about it. After that there were many other poets who wrote about it, till, in the sixth century, Adi Shankaracharya very clearly wrote about the Kundalini and its awakening. Nobody has said so far, from those ancient writers, that Kundalini gives you any problems, or She makes you dance, jump and all that — is all modern nonsense. Traditionally, nobody has said so. Sixth century is the time when Adi Shankaracharya incarnated on this Earth. Buddha got His realisation without doing any dancing or anything. You know for definite.\n",

Yesterday was a great experience for people. I’m sure today also it will work out the same way. You have to do exactly as I tell you, which is a very simple thing, you don’t have to do anything great, just take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us. Just take out your shoes. Just take out your shoes, sit comfortably; if you have anything tight on your body, just remove it, but keep yourself comfortable. Put your hands on your laps. One thing is, you have to be comfortable, so that during the process you don’t feel any uncomfortable feeling. So please just put your right-hands… both the hands towards Me first of all, just hands like this. \n",

      "Now we are very happy that the awareness is coming to the seekers, that a lot of them are realizing that they have not found the truth. If you are reaching that conclusion that you have to find the truth within yourself, then Sahaja Yoga will work wonders. Now, our evolutionary process has not been anything which is dead, it is a living process. There is a force within us which brings forth our evolution, and living process cannot be activated by mental activity. For example, if you put a seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself. By saying that ‘You’d better sprout now,’ or by saying that ‘it has sprouted,’ you’ll have just mental satisfaction of creating an imaginary, image. But actually, it has to happen. The happening has to take place. And this happening is built within you. That has to happen within your being and is already – you’re destined for it. As he has told you, that lies in the triangular bone, which is very [inaudible] – you can’t even see them. I think it is drawn very small, we should really enlarge it and show – that is the triangular bone within us, which contains this force called as the Kundalini. Now regarding Kundalini, you must have read many books also.\n",

      "Now, see today, I came first of all here, at seven o’clock, and they said there are very few people. So I went round and I came back. I said, ‘That’s the trouble, they don’t want anything simple.’ But whatever is living is so simple. You cannot explain it mentally. You put, as I said, a seed into the Mother Earth, how it sprouts, how a flower becomes a fruit, all these things you cannot explain mentally. It’s a living process done by the all-pervading Power which is the love of God, and that activates and works it out and naturalise, which you cannot by your mental process understand, nor can you do it. You can’t transform one flower into fruit. So this is what one has to understand, that is has to be a living process within us. And the living process is spontaneous. That is why we say ‘sahaja’ – ‘saha’ means ‘with’ and ‘ja’ means ‘born.’ It’s born with you, it’s spontaneous. Like your breathing is born with you, like your pulsation is born with you, like everything which is born with you, you take it for granted, it exists. In the same way, this Kundalini is born with you. And this awakening is also your birthright, as a human being you have the right to have this awakening within you and you should have it and you must seek that. But, because of no education on this point, perhaps, traditionally, we are not educated to understand. \n",

      "Christ came on this Earth; when He wanted to explain all these things He had to go away and He lived only for four years to talk to people, and in that four years the way people behaved, and the way they never accepted Him, it was impossible to talk to you about Kundalini. But in the Bible it is written, ‘I will appear before you like tongues,’ even in all the Torahs it is written, ‘I will appear before you like flames of tongues.’ Now, what are these flames? These are the chakras which are within us; when you see them, they look like that, the flames, you can see them clearly. But it is not the seeing the that is important, it is being; people think that if you see the light, now you become the light. If you see the light [Shri Mataji shows the ceiling], you become the light? It’s simple, simple thing you can understand: you do not become a light if you see the light [Shri Mataji shows the ceiling]. You have to become the light, and when you become the light, what happens, that you act like light. Your power acts like a light. When you are there people can see how to walk, they know how to understand the difference between a carpet and a chair and a human being. The discrimination is there. When there is light, you discriminate and you start understanding that the truth is this and this is untruth. \n",

      "Now to cure these people is very easy. You have to just raise the Kundalini and the Kundalini can enlighten that centre and your innocence can come back. Your chastity will show its result. Your face will change. People I have seen after realisation become twenty years younger immediately because of this centre, which is bestowed upon by the deity of Shri Ganesha, who is the embodiment of eternal childhood. And this Shri Ganesha later on takes His birth at the higher chakra called Agnya, as our Lord Jesus Christ. That I'll tell you tomorrow, about Jesus Christ, who He was, how He came on this Earth and what are the reference to Him in the ancient scriptures of India. So the centre of Mooladhara − the lesser the better. I think it is for you to understand that chastity plays a very important part. If the person has got this problem, then the Kundalini does rise, no doubt. It rises but is again sucked back. Even the people who are too much on the right-hand side, always think too much and work very hard and earning money for their wives, find their wives run away. Because they are very hard people to live with. They are very hot-tempered, irritable, and aggressive. So here the man earns everything for the wife and there he finds the wife has run away by the time he comes home. \n",

      "Let Me tell you about His own subtle methods by which He came on this Earth. In the Devi Puran, which you people seldom read – I think it is translated in English – which was written fourteen thousand years back. As I told you, only fifty years back all these nonsensical people came and got all the perverted, useless literature printed and everybody is basing their analogies on those fifty years, which are nothing compared to the traditional thousands of years which were spent in India in seeking God. Fourteen thousand years back, Markandeya, a great poet, has written about Kundalini, has written about the Mother. He has written about Christ. He called Him Mahavishnu because He is the Son of Vishnu. He has described it in such a way that if you read it you'll be amazed, you'll think all these special points of Christ are described. He was called as the support, adhara, of the universe. On Kundalini it can be proved also that He was Mahavishnu. Because when the Kundalini rises, which is a living process as I told you, is not some humbug that you just start jumping and shooting and this thing, all this is a kind of a nonsense. But when actually you see the pulsation rising within you, then you can see very clearly that when it stops here you have to take the name of Lord Jesus Christ, otherwise it won't open out. This position, where you see the Agnya Chakra is, it won't open out unless and until you take the name of Lord Jesus Christ. \n",

Actually, I would say My great father, who was a great realised-soul – he was My guru as far as human beings are concerned – because he told Me, to understand human beings, you have to become absolutely a human being. And those people who came on this Earth did not understand that human beings are absolutely blind. Unless and until you raise the Kundalini of people en masse, you won't be able to communicate with them, and you can see clearly that any discovery that is made in any field whatsoever has to be made en masse for the utility of everyone. Unless and until that is made, the dilemma of religion manifests itself. Whatever has been said about religion as they appear to us and are apparent is true, I agree. But for that, we cannot blame any one of these true incarnations of divine love. \n",

      "I went to a place called Kolhapur, where I was alone. I had nobody, no Sahaj Yogis to help Me. And I said, now how am I to cure, there were three thousand people in a garden of a senator, and they were supposed to be cured by Sahaja Yoga. So, I just touched the Mother Earth and said, ‘Oh Mother Earth, please take away their sins. You can do it.’ But nothing would happen. Nothing would happen. The Kundalini of the Mother Earth is not sucking at all. I said, ‘Oh Mother Earth, I come from the country of yoga. A country where great seers, saints, incarnations have poured their love. I have touched that Mother Earth with My feet. Now, I touch you with My hand. I take the name of that great country of Mine.’ You will be amazed that vibrations started flowing in, and one and all, all of them got cured. This is your land. This is your soil. This is your heritage. And what are we talking about, I just don't understand. For Me, it is beyond My understanding where are we. Even in the times to come or which have gone through, such a great potential of energy, the shakti, you cannot find anywhere. \n",

      "Now this is a living process, as you cannot force a seed to sprout. It sprouts by itself, spontaneously, but you have to put it in the Mother Earth. In the same way it sprouts. It sprouts spontaneously and when it happens then you have to see for yourself. One can help because if there is an obstruction on any chakras, especially if the Nabhi Chakra is caught up, then what happens that on that centre the Kundalini tries to push and you can easily see with your naked eyes the pulsation or the movement of your sacrum bone just like a heart, just like a heart. These things you cannot manoeuvre, you cannot attain by effort. Is a thing already settled there within you and this has to be awakened.\n",

      "So, the wind comes from some other source, that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini. And also you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you. Compared to many other seekers who came before you, I must say, you are very fortunate. Because worshipping any ‘vigraha,’ any − even a statue of self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth, people had big problems. They had to first of all do a meditation which was called as ‘Savi Kalpa samadhi.’ That means, in that state you had to concentrate on such a statue, ‘vigraha.’ ‘Vigraha’ means the one which is a vibrating statue. And then go on looking at that statue and trying to raise your Kundalini. And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya. \n",

      "Fourteen thousand years back in India, the originator of the astrology in India, called as Bhrigu Muni, has predicted that such a system will start in 1970. Actually, he didn't write 1970, he wrote according to Indian calendar. But three hundred years back, another Indian, called Swami Bhujander, transcribed it [in Marathi] and said that it had to start in 1970. Sahaja Yoga started in 1970. Also, it was said that in this new method of Sahaja Yoga, thousands of people will get awakening of the Kundalini in a 'sahaja' way, in a spontaneous way, and that you will not have to work hard for it or to do any kind of penance − tapasharya. This was predicted so far as that, that after some time, when such yogis will be created on this Earth, there will be no need of hospitals. It has gone even further –it's quite a long thing – but I'm just telling you that it has been predicted a long time back.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: Today, we have to know something about the connection of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth. It is very important that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth. She has been very kind to all of you. She has been sucking your vibrations. She has been, otherwise also, She has given you everything that you see around. So today, we have to understand the connection and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves. I’ve told you before also that Kundalini, which is in three-and-a-half coils is placed within the triangular bone. Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth or in the puja it is represented as the Kumbha. I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not?\n",

      "Shri Mataji: Okay. [Shri Mataji takes the microphone in Her hand. Sahaja Yogis laugh] And also, the consciousness has been moving towards the understanding of all the other four elements but the Mother Earth. That had to be such, because unless and until the understanding of all these four other elements are brought to a certain degree, the Mother Earth cannot express itself. Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up, you cannot raise the Kundalini, you cannot give Self-Realisation. You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done. That’s why we had yagyas, all other methods of exciting the four elements. They worshipped the water and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light. And that’s how we came up to the time of Christ where light was worshipped.\n",

      "But Earth is very different from this dynamic power that is flowing through those wires which are zero, which mean nothing. In the same way, in a woman, the womb of a woman, is the Kundalini. Now what is a womb? Now if that is the Kundalini, that expresses the Kundalini in the gross, that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb. Now what does a womb do? It receives the sperm, which is just a frivolous act of man or you can say just aggression, and She then nourishes and looks after it, corrects it and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way but in a very compassionate and a sensible way, till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up. \n",

      "Now this revolution will only take place when this masculine development is achieved with nourishment from the feminine part – see, from the womb, from the Mother Earth. You see so far, we have been exploiting the Mother Earth you see, creating all kinds of problems – the men, I must say have done it. Now there is [unclear] and this is the time that [unclear] called as Kundalini, is expressing the womb. It represents that feminine personality within us which rises, rises. It’s called as also as Kumbha, which you call as Aquarius. It represents as Aquarius, which is why this is the Age of the Aquarius. Here this Kundalini rises and She gives you the realisation. First, human beings have to be developed up to this stage as you are, and then this Kundalini has to rise, so the time has come – the blossom time has come.

      "Now the time has come for the nourishment of the womb, nourishment by the womb, nourishment by the Mother Earth. So the consciousness has to now move towards the nourishment. So those who are coming to us now in Sahaja Yoga actually get their nourishment through the power of the Kundalini, which represents the womb. It represents the Mother Earth within us, the Mother Earth within us. So the whole preparation is made already – masculine – and now the nourishment is needed. And that is the job of Sahaja Yoga today, in the modern times. So when the Kundalini raises, She nourishes your subtle centres, which are the source of all energies. And She also gets connected to the Spirit, which is just a witness.\n",

We are taking it for granted because the Mother Earth, we are exhausting Her, morning till evening. And we do not know what harm we are doing to Her and to ourselves. But when you feel this cool breeze in your hand, and then you go, say, near a tree, the tree sucks that. If it is a sick tree, it becomes perfectly all right. If it is not giving any fruits, it starts giving fruits. If you give this energy to some human being, you don’t get any troubles. But that person gets his Self-Realisation, you know how he gets it. You know where the Kundalini is obstructed, where the force is obstructed. You know how to cure it. And you give him his Self-Realisation by which he receives his complete peace and tranquillity.\n",

      "Have we become really righteous people? Have we really become people of God? In Sahaja Yoga, the Kundalini is one that is the power of your pure desire; resides in the triangular bone. In the Bible it is described, ‘I will appear before you like tongues of flames.’ Now, who can explain this? But after realisation, you will know that these centres appear like flames, beautiful flames of different colours. So this power which resides in the triangular bone is also known to Muslims. They call it ‘assas.’ And to Christians − very well known − though it is a mystery to them; it is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. That is the Mother God. The womb. The Mother Earth. That nourishes. That makes you grow. That makes all your development sensible. That makes you understand the totality, the whole. That comforts you. That redeems you. That counsels you. That’s the reflection in this triangular bone, is the Holy Ghost.\n",

      "All other incarnations have the body from the Mother Earth. But He was born of the Spirit, He was the Spirit. And that’s why He could achieve this. And He has said that, at the time of Holy Ghost, will be born of your Spirit, by the Spirit. It’s very interesting, the way He has expressed Himself. And when He has resurrected Himself, He has created a personality within us, which if we awaken, we can also crossover. So this is the door through which everyone has to pass. But that doesn’t mean that you can pass through this door by going to a church. Or by reading Bible. Or by saying Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ. Your Kundalini has to pass through that centre. That is the door He has described. And He didn’t say He is the destination, though He is in a way, because when you enter into the realm of formless. Into the realm of the limbic area, which is the Kingdom of God. Or we can say that where we are dressed to go into the subtler consciousness, by piercing through this area [top of the head] like a reception hall. \n",

For example, if the trees grow very big outside, as our civilization has grown, it has to see its own source, source of vitality, of nourishment. Otherwise, the whole tree is going to collapse.

But I’m sure Sahaja Yogis will understand this subtle point and they’ll be able to use it to convince others.

Rebellion is not the word that will result into something great, it is the revolution, so that it moves finally upward, so your consciousness become a higher consciousness with nourishment. Just like the Mother Earth nourishes us, the Kundalini nourishes us completely.

People wrote about God, talked about God, preached about God, did a lot on the manly side. And the Tree of Life grew too much outside. But now the time has come for the Mother Earth to nourish, the Kundalini to nourish. She is the Aquarius and this is the Age of the Aquarius. In Sanskrit language called as Kumbha, which means they worship before every puja. So it is the feminine qualities that have to nourish. Of course, as I told you, it is not feminist, which is absolutely another ‘ism.’ Women trying to become men, that’s ridiculous. Again the pendulum. But now, when all this growth has taken place, like this instrument is made, now let it go to the mains. So men these modern times, who are compassionate, who are forbearing, who are nourishing, will be worshipped. And not men who try to aggress others. Like I would say Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi. All these men are of a different quality altogether.\n",

You do not have a mind somewhere – you don’t want to do it but you have to do it, because rationally it is good, it will fetch more money. Nothing of the kind… you do it because it is absolute.

      "But this power still is there, quietly, intact, settled down there and it just wants to get a chance to give you your second birth because She is your mother. She is within you, in every one of you, a separate mother. I don’t know in these days even motherhood is such corrupt stuff that I do not know how to talk about motherhood to you. But I would say that like the Mother Earth, she represents the Mother Earth, the Aquarius. In the Sanskrit language she is called as Kumba, means the Aquarius. She’s the Aquarius and the job of that Aquarius is to nourish, to soothe and that’s what the job of this Kundalini is.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: And they just wanted to say about Holy Ghost that it's a mystery; they never wanted to say that it is the Mother. If you see in the consciousness of people today, they are very conscious of the feminine side of the women. Of course, I am against feminism, because that's not the way: we are not to become men. It's not the question of men becoming women, women becoming men, because it is a pendulous movement. You see, you move from one to another. But, if it is a living, evolutionary process, then you have to move spirally and reach at a higher point than what you are. So, the nourishment comes to you from the Mother Earth − represented within you as the Holy Ghost − is the power that we call as Kundalini, in the ancient times; this is the most ancient knowledge of our country, traditionally accepted. Even in Greece, it was accepted because it is placed in the sacrum bone, and the sacrum means 'sacred,’ means the Greeks knew that the bone is sacred and has something sacred in it.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: I was born; My thing is that I was born like that, but you can become higher because within you, God has placed all the arrangements, all the mechanism. Only thing, you have to be connected. The mechanism is called as the Kundalini, which is placed in the triangular bone, and when it ascends, just like a living thing − like a seed being sprouted when you place it in the Mother Earth. Now you don't read about, do you, you don't sort of pay for it, just you have to place it there; the Mother has the capacity to nourish the seed and to sprout it. And the seed has everything in it, that's how it works. So it is spontaneous happening within yourself. But the another misunderstanding people have, that anything − unconscious thing − that happens to you, for that you have to go to your subconscious and these stratas is all absolutely wrong: this will make the whole nation mad. I really tell you, this is what people are doing, this parapsychology and all that − it's a very dangerous stuff. \n",

      "Shri Mataji: Oh, what a very big question My child. I’ll tell you later on if you don’t mind, all right? It requires a whole lecture. Doesn’t matter. But we are made of five elements, all right? And then there is Kundalini within us and also there is the Spirit. Now, if a dead soul – when one dies, it never dies fully. What happens is that the Earth element comes out and the water element also comes out. The rest of the three elements remain and the Spirit and the Kundalini remain on top of that. And that is the dead soul. And a living soul is a person, which has got the Spirit, and thinks also that it means his soul − I don’t know, these English words are quite confusing – but a ‘jivatma,’ as they call it, is a person who is living, has got a Spirit, has got a Kundalini and has got a…\n",

      "One must know that Kundalini is the nourishing thing for you. As soon as you start bringing the Spirit in your attention the Kundalini rises. When She rises, She gives strength to your physical being. You know that these chakras are made out of the elements. The first two chakras are made out of the Mother Earth. So the Mother Earth is a very important thing for us. For such people who feel they are dragged down in their physical energies you must try to sit on the Mother Earth and request Her to give you strength. She’s the one who really now is acting, the kruta, it has started working. So far we have been getting after Her all the time. This is the only element, the Mother Earth, which does not act spontaneously enough. Only the gravity of Her acts, and we are gravitated towards Her. But otherwise all of Her other qualities we have to go to Her. We have to dig in and we have to plant something so that something grows and then we have to go to it… You have to put some sort of an effort to get to Her, to use Her energy of nourishment. But She’s the most nourishing thing. She is the one who is nourishment personified. When you sit on Her and you felt Her and if you are a realised-soul you’ll find an upsurge of energy coming out. Not only that, She comes up to your head and then She takes down all that is not wanted. It’s sort of a cleaning process comes up first of all and then you are filled with energy of Mother Earth.\n",

      "This Mother Earth is such a big thing, we have no idea, and Her consciousness that we now have to know is Kundalini. Kundalini represents the Mother Earth within you, the feminine qualities. We talk of feminists, now that feminism is something absurd, to become man to the woman, woman to the man. It’s all pendulum-like movement and you know whatever moves in a pendulum is not progressing. You have to move in a spiral. I hope you understand about the peptones. If they become linear they get destroyed, all their identity is lost. But if they retain their spiral nature, then they progress. In the same way we, too, have to go in our consciousness in a spiral way and jump higher than what we are. That’s only possible with a spring of Kundalini, which is nothing but a representation of Mother Earth within us. She’s the Mother Earth.\n",

      "The authority doesn’t come to you from going to any school, college or anything. It comes to you from God Himself. It cannot come to you… say, if this Mother Earth has the authority that if you put any seed in it, it spontaneously sprouts because it’s the quality of the Mother Earth that does the job. So all the living processes are done through the quality of the personality of, say, the Mother Earth or the sun or the moon. All of them have that quality to do it. In the same way, the person who has that qualification to do it can only awaken the Kundalini. Every Tom, Dick and Harry cannot do it. But it started just after the sixth century. This thing started very much in India. People started making money out of it, that we are going to raise your Kundalini, Kundalini can be the reason, this can happen, that can happen.\n",

      "Then they started saying that you have to pass through your subconscious because they found these people were all possessed, they got lost and became recluses. Many people who got this kind of Kundalini awakening went into funny situations. Then a great personality, Guru Nanak, came on this Earth and He said that all these nonsensical things are not what Kundalini is. The Kundalini is your Mother and She rises without any trouble to different chakras, and the one who supported Him and explained Sahaja Yoga in a very good way was the great personality of Kabira. Kabira has described everything about Kundalini, only in poetry. \n",

      "But human beings have a great sense of how to twist and turn everything into something that’s just the opposite. Like He talked about the Kundalini and called Kundalini as suryati and he lived in Behar and he preached about it in Behar and there, people called tobacco as the suryati. You can imagine how people twist the truth into just the opposite. This has happened with every great incarnation who came on this Earth. It was very clearly openly talked about by Shri Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth century because He said it should not be done secretly anymore, we should not be very selective. We have to give this knowledge to the masses because the day will come when people will get their mass realisation and they should be prepared for it.\n",

      "So people formed another venue, big organizations were formed. The last sixty years we’ve had all kinds of these pseudo-intellectual religious leaders in our country. And then came another type who were absolutely fake people who started saying that when you get your realisation, before that, you have to become mad. Unless and until you become mad you cannot get your realisation. So the poor Kundalini has to suffer. The seekers, who are a special category of people, are to be born in these modern times. They have to be born because this is the day of judgment. Here you are going to be judged by your Kundalini, and if you do not accept that judgment then when are you going to do it? It’s only your Kundalini which is going to judge you. She’s your Mother. She doesn’t trouble you. She doesn’t do any harm to you. She is the one who represents the Aquarius, the Kumbha, the Aquarian Age they say, but they don’t know what it is. What does it do? It represents the Mother Earth within us. The Mother Earth who nourishes us, who soothes us, who comforts us and who takes us to the living reality of life, that you are the Spirit. \n",

      "Because in India, the whole climate is such that you can live under a tree, live in a forest no problem, you can eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest. There is no need to have bed or anything; it is so warm and nice, and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest. And thus many people went into the forest and started thinking, looking at whole world from that solitude, what is the problem with human being? Why are we here? What should we do? What is the purpose of this human life? Why God has given us this beautiful human life? They started thinking about it. And that is how they went to meditative position, meditative entry within themselves. And when they started meditating they found out all about Kundalini, about chakras and the deities that reside on them. Now these deities have resided from eternal times, we can say, in the abode of God, they have all resided there and then they were reflected on this Earth and they incarnated just to give us a better and better awareness.\n",

      "Now the principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture, has to be there. Now the Mother’s character is that She is the One who is the Womb, She is the One Who is the Mother Earth and She is the One who nourishes you. She nourishes us, you know that. And this feminine thing in every human being resides as this Kundalini as you have seen. And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness which becomes compassion, which is flowing, which becomes soothing, nourishing energy of love. And that’s what today people are saying feminist − all this thing and all that. That’s again a pendulum − a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man − all these problems you have had because of this. But when you move spirally upward, then where do you move you become a personality full of compassion, of love, of universal understanding, through collective consciousness. And then you rise up to a position where you become universally conscious. So that is what should happen to you. And if that happens, then we should say that your motherly qualities within you have risen. And that’s what we have so far neglected. You do not become a woman but you become motherly. First the Father, then the Son and now the Mother! All right?\n",

      "Shri Mataji: I would say, I don’t say that women as women who are born as women only have the role, even the men have, everyone has, because everyone has Kundalini within them. But the women must know that if they are women, they have a greater responsibility. Not that they should sit at home and only look after children and brood and then nag the husbands when they come home. That’s not their role. The role is such that they have to be forbearing. Any person who is the mother has to be like the Mother Earth. How much She is forbearing! How much She suffers! We dig Her out, we torture Her life still She is giving all the time; She is soothing, forgiving, bearing it out, you see. Then we are doing so many sinful things, I mean, She should explode real with anger, the way it is. But She does not, She is very careful, She slowly, slowly informs that, “Now get out of this place, it’s rumbling”. She is so kind, you see? That all should come to us. So it’s not that it is only the women who should settle down with these qualities, but the time has come that men have to have these qualities. Otherwise, there will be always an imbalance. So now the men have to become extremely kind, affectionate, compassionate. Give up that competitive spirit, that fighting spirit like Napoleon had. All those ideas are outdated. Now whom do you respect? People like Mahatma Gandhi or Abraham Lincoln. Everyone… An American should think of Abraham Lincoln.\n",

      "But what is the relationship between matter and this? We should see that point. It’s important. Now through the matter all our centres are made. For example, the two centres that are down below are made of the Mother Earth principle. And then another one and another one like that. All these elements have contributed to make the centres. And these centres are just like mirrors made and the reflection of the Divine falls on them. Then at a human level the matter improves so much, goes into such evolutionary processes, that the reflection at the heart level improves so much that the Spirit shines there, and the Kundalini is properly set for your evolution, which is the epitome of evolution. Like this instrument that is made one by one, first collecting this part, that part, that part, then put together. Now the time has come for you to be put to the mains. Now this has nothing to do with the electricity, if you see. It exists without electricity but it can carry the electricity. In the same way, we become the lamp, and when we become the lamp the light can be brought in and we become enlightened. So there is a big relationship between the lamp and the light. But light cannot exist without the lamp, so lamp has to be there.\n",

      "So now the thing is that as a Mother I give all sort of grace to these people, grace marks I should say, when they said that the sex can take you to Kundalini, because you know, in the beginning they must have tried something like that and they must have seen the expression of the deity which has got a trunk, you see, which is settled on this centre. We call it as Ganapati who actually incarnated as Christ on this earth, later on. But He is the Ganapati. And there you see just a trunk and they must have misunderstood that this trunk is the Kundalini, because it has a shape like that. And that’s why they might have said it, but it’s the most dangerous thing. If you go through sex, then you are open yourself absolutely to hell. If you go towards sex and try to come to God, it’s absolutely wrong, you see?\n",

You have to become a guru, a pure sattwa and then the guru of others. In short, Sahaja Yoga is the epitome of our evolution. That is what we are made human beings for. All these scientific methods that have come upon this earth, all these explorations that are there are to communicate about Sahaja Yoga, nothing else. If you use them for anything else they will have no impact, no achievement and everything will be wasted. Doctor, did you talk to them about the peptones and all that?\n",

      "So the Mother has to play a very beautiful role, very carefully she has to nourish her children, she has to look after them, she has to bring them up, and should be then entering into the Kingdom of God. Then only you can enter into the Kingdom of God and that is a thing of great patience, love and tremendous power. If you don’t have power, say if this Mother Earth did not have power, she could not have borne us. With all the kinds of horrible things going on, the way we are digging her, the way we are torturing her, she would have collapsed long time back. But she has such a tremendous power of forgiveness, of compassion, love and nourishment that she is activated. And your Kundalini is the same Mother Earth, she is the representation of the same Mother Earth, the same Holy Ghost, of the same kumbha – as you call it, the Aquarius. That’s the Aquarian Age they call it because this is the Age when you will get your nourishment. Your own Kundalini is going to nourish you, she is going to soothe you, she is going to guide you properly. The Mother is the greatest guru. I mean even the gurus have their mata. A guru has to be a mata otherwise how will they come? The whole absurdity has come to us out in the West from many religions, especially Christianity and Judaism, where they did not talk of the Mother at all. That was not the time to talk, because at the time of Abraham, they had to talk of the Father, then at the time of Christ they had to talk of the Son. That was the time because if He had talked about his own mother they would have killed her and then He would have come out with his eleven destroying powers. He would have finished the whole show once for all. So He never talked about the mother power.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: You live in that position on Earth in the sense that your brain is like a prism. The human brain has a special capacity, more than the animals have. In them the ego and superego are balanced in the head and that it has risen high like that. In the prism, if you know the laws of science, when the rays fall on that and when there is a double type of density in the brain because you have gray cells and white cells, it goes into refraction and when it goes into refraction, the one ray that falls, the ray of consciousness goes into refraction and that refraction passes like this. Some of it goes inside and crosses this way and that way. So when it comes out, that is the resultant. I don’t know if there is a scientist sitting here. That is the result of two forces – one goes out and one goes inside. This attention that goes out makes you see things more outside than inside and most of it is outside. Human attention is outside. If I tell you put your attention inside you cannot. But when you get realisation, what happens, the Kundalini rises. And when that happens, then your attention gets sucked in and that’s how you start feeling inside. Because your Kundalini is not awakened, your attention goes outside. But little bit you go inside also. Because the resultant is like this. Sometimes a little goes inside and then again you come out. Another thing is that a thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off. In between there’s a very little space and that’s the present. You touch that. But normally you jump on the cusps. But suddenly you see some beautiful thing or something that’s emitting vibrations, then you just go there. You just slip from your thoughts and go there. But for a split of a second. That’s why it happens. But after realisation that space improves and you are above that.\n",

We have to sit comfortably – not bending too much or putting yourself backwards too much – but just in a straight manner. Put your left hand towards me like this.

These six centres or seven centres are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual being. And all our problems come through the jeopardies; when these centres go into jeopardy. So to correct them Kundalini has to rise. When She rises, She corrects those centres by enlightening them. She integrates those centres. And ultimately She connects you to this all-pervading Power of divine love. Look at these flowers. From where do they come? It’s such a miracle. But we take it for granted. These flowers are created by this Mother Earth through the same Power of divine love. This Power is very intelligent, at the same time full of compassion. This Power acts in every sphere of life wherever something living has to be done. And that living work is done within us also.\n",

      "Now, the third condition, as I said is extremely simple but you can make it difficult, is to forgive each and every person, even without thinking about them. Because logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. Moreover, the Kundalini has to pass through this Agnya Chakra, which is placed in the optic chiasma and is a very constricted cross thing. And if you do not really forgive from your heart – I mean, don’t have to do anything, just have to say, ‘I forgive everyone from my heart’ – if you do not do that, then this centre doesn't open and the Kundalini doesn't rise. As it is, you have tortured yourself all your life and now you want to miss out on your Self-Realisation; this is no wisdom. These are the only three simple conditions. Now, can I request you to take out your shoes, because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Those who are standing can come and sit here, it would be helpful.

      "‘Sahaja’ means ‘is born with you’. It is spontaneous, it's a living process like you put the seed in the Mother earth it sprouts because the Mother earth has the capacity to sprout, and the seed has the capability to sprout. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to also sacrifice and suffer, Christ has suffered for you already, why should you suffer now? Why should we suffer to meet God? No father would like that. He is the Father of all the fathers. He is the source of compassion and love. So why should you suffer? What is the need for you to suffer? Only thing we have to awaken Christ within you, so it works out and you'll be amazed to see that you are glorious, you are great, you are not a person who is under bondage, the bondage of any habits, bondage of any destructive forces. Thus you can achieve so many things because when this Kundalini rises, She passed through these six centres, She nourishes them, integrates them and also connects you to that Divine Power.\n",

And that's why the Mother Earth has got the magnet. It is most surprising. That's why people wear, you see, all these beautiful fragrances, to attract others or to soothe others. So fragrance of the Mother Earth if you can enlighten. Even while Kundalini is rising within you is the Mother Earth also, the element of Mother Earth. Where is it? In the lowest, that lowest chakra, there is the Mother Earth. It's made from the Prithvi Tattwa, from the Mother Earth, the essence of the Mother Earth. Suddenly you start getting lot of fragrance within you. And you don't know from where this fragrance is coming.

      "Even there are people who say that we are Self-Realisation people. And what do they do? They cut the tongue and say put it back here. Why because it is said that when the Kundalini rises there’s a khechari that take place. The tongue is pulled back. But when the Kundalini rises then. It’s like when the car moves the wheels will move… But before that if you start moving the wheels will the car move. Will it move? And this Kundalini awakening is a spontaneous happening. Is done by living force within us? How did we become human beings? What did we do about it? It all happens spontaneous. How much did we pay? To whom did we pay to become human beings? Which guru did that? No one. So the Kundalini awakening has to be a spontaneous happening. But as in evolutionary process one fish came out then few fishes came out and were followed by shoals of fishes. In the same way one person has to do it. That’s different point but that you can pay for it is absurd and irrelevant thing because when you have to sow a seed, the seed has a power to germinate and the Mother Earth power to nourish it. That’s how it works out. Spontaneously you don’t pay anything to the Mother Earth, or for transforming flowers into fruits. Do we pay to the tree? So you cannot pay. Neither you can put in any effort for it. It is just spontaneous. \n",

      "It can be done, if we understand this centre of Agnya. It is placed between the two optic chasms crossing, like this. And when the Kundalini pierces through it, the Deity in that centre is awakened. This is the Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. First, he is conceptualized by the Divine, in the first chakra of Mooladhara. So he is the Deity of innocence, which incarnates on this earth. Not only this, but it is the body of Christ was made of vibrations. That is why he could walk on the water. He has told a very simple thing, that we have to forgive others, as God has to forgive us. As soon as you forgive others, and ask for forgiveness, this centre opens. And then Christ is awakened, is born within you, or can say awakened, and he sucks in these two institutions of ego and your conditioning, which is called as superego. So these two institutions are sucked in and the brain opens out like a lotus. Inside is the limbic area. And the Kundalini then passes through your fontanel-bone-area. But the most important thing is, first this centre has to be completely opened out. \n",

How can this box do it? In the same way, we think about us as boxes, we are not, we are fantastic, and everything is built in within us. Like a seed, when you put it in the Mother earth sprout by itself, because it is built-in in the seed to sprout, and because the Mother earth has the power to sprout it. So, it’s all built-in within us, only thing is now we have to do is to awaken this power of Kundalini and to open it out to that all-pervading Power. It’s very simple, this journey of three to four feet at the most and it takes hardly any time. No one can believe that you are so fantastic, unless and until it happens to you, you will not believe, but even after happening you should not get lost. I remember the parable of Christ, that some seeds got just sprouted and were lost. You should not be one of them, you should respect yourself, you should respect your realisation and understand what powers you have. You are capable of so many things, you can cure others, you can cure yourself, always lead a very healthy life, and you create a new society, a new race of people who are realised souls, who are saints, who are angels.\n",

      "Now with this another chakra which is always caught is the Agnya, Agnya chakra. In the Agnya chakra we have to become thoughtlessly aware but we can’t. Now if you watch your thoughts you will know mostly we think of the people who have harmed us, who have troubled us, sometimes we have the glimpse of the good things also. We think of the good people also, sometimes, normally we are thinking about the people who have harmed us, hurt us, this thing, that. Now, Christ who is Shri Ganesha and who has all the powers to kill us and finish us off and destroy us completely has given us the greatest weapon, is to forgive. So the mantra here is ‘forgive’ and you have to see that you forgive others. Anybody says anything, forgive. When you forgive, God takes over. And He knows how to handle or mishandle, to do whatever He likes to that person. That’s not your job, you just forgive, so you give him a ticket, go to God, I forgive you, and you, you have to forgive you have nothing to do, that is the thing, you can enjoy your Agnya chakra very well, and raise your Kundalini beyond by saying ‘forgive, forgive, forgive’, three times, and you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara, no thoughts. Agnya is the one which brings thoughts to you, that’s why Christ was so particular on the eyes, that ‘thou shall not have adulterous eyes’, try to concentrate your eyes on the Mother Earth for some time, she’ll suck in, so that your attention doesn’t become that wobbly, becomes concentrated, and equalized and balanced. When that is done your eyes become so powerful even if you look at somebody, you can cure that person and the innocence will start coming in your eyes, you will not have lust and greed.\n",

And when Kundalini comes to this chakra, you become thoughtless because these two things, which is shown here, Ego and Superego, your conditionings and your ego both gets pulled and then your fontanel bone area, which we call as talu, opens up and the moment it opens, Kundalini crosses the same. All these are built in inside you. Like now, you see you all have come here, so many bulbs are there, and to light it you just press on the switch there and all the lights are illuminated. How does it happen? Because all these are made up. All these are made up inside you. Just like how many saplings or how many trees are going to grow from one seed is all mapped out; you put the seeds in Mother Earth and it will grow. Now what have you done?

Otherwise, just like a seed after sprouting becomes waste, like that in India, people get realisation very fast. I don’t have to do anything. This is the blessing of your earth. Outside I have to work very hard. In India I don’t have to work hard. People get realisation just like that. His Kundalini gets awakened very fast. Because of blessings of so many people you are born in this country. Lot of blessing. That is why you are born in this country. Now you will understand how fast your Kundalini rises. But after that you have to grow in this. Once the connection is established with this divine energy, union takes place.

So we have to now understand that we have not yet solved our problems, and if we have to solve our problems we have to become the Spirit. For this you can not pay, what can we pay for a living process, supposing you have to sprout a seed, what do we pay for the Mother earth, she doesn't understand money. First thing you must know you can not pay for it and if anybody says that you have to pay then you know it's all falsehood, it's some sorts of a black magic that they put some sort of a Spirit in you and you feel some sort of a feeling and that passes out and it doesn't give you any powers. It has to give you the power of raising the Kundalini of others and giving them realisation, but talking about the knowledge, is like talking about the electricity, the history of electricity, instead of just switching on, because after all it's all built in within you, so better is to get your realisation and then better talk about it, and know about it and get all the knowledge.\n",

He has created you and He is going to work out your realisation. It is His job. He has to do it.

Then, if that is so, that means only Adam and Eve, two would have lived on this Earth. And these people were not with Adam and Eve to know what they did. And this absurd idea was very much there also at the time of Shri Krishna among Indians. And as a result of that, we had ascetics who were very hot tempered. They developed one-sided personality, of, say, a sun-like. If they looked at somebody, they could just burn him off: ‘bhasma’ [ashes].

Nothing, and that is going to be difficult to accept that without doing anything ourselves, how are we going to achieve it? That's why Sahaja Yoga moves very, very slowly.

      "Shri Mataji: No. No. It's all right. Just put them. I mean if they are not absolutely rubber. Rubber socks may be difficult, but otherwise all right. Just put your feet on the Mother Earth. Just simple like this and you don't have to touch me. You have to just put your hands towards me. Like this. Now the left side as you know is the power of desire. And the right side is the power of action. Normally there is no need to do anything like that. Normally. In the Indian villages, I don't do all these things. But in the West, I think we better do it because you will raise your own Kundalini. I will not. You will raise your own Kundalini. That's the point.\n",

      "One day I went to Aurangabad, where a boy told Me that brahmachaitanya is beyond feeling and non-feeling. He had read about it in some book. I told him it was true, but he should forget about it and just feel it. It was then that I decided to tell about it to a few people. You see, the right time also had to come before I disclosed it. All other religions have so far been segmented and on-integrated. Now the whole integration has come. I can now explain Christ, Mohammed sahib and others, because they are all part and parcel of the whole, which is brahmachaitanya. Do not talk about Me to the scientists. Just tell them that this is a unique method that has come. Though it is a little difficult to understand, yet it has happened and we have seen it for ourselves. Like that you tell them. If you talk about Me, they will be shocked. Maximum you can tell them that – ‘this knowledge was brought out by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, by which the Kundalini could be risen. How she has managed it, we do not know. It is probably a secret.’ Put the whole thing on Me. Now you understand. Can you say how does a seed sprout? By putting it in the mother earth. So you say, that by putting everything to Mataji, our seed has sprouted. It is a living process and we have seen it for ourselves.\n",

      "The opening of the Sahasraras is sudden. With a bang it opens. How can I explain, − it gives the effect of one telescope into another. Normally with the opening of the Agnya and the Vishuddi, the ego and the super-ego get sucked in. Mind is superego. Ahankara is ego. Our soul or atmanis surrounded by all the five elements plus their causal expression, with the Kundalini on the periphery. The elements are mainly the earth and the water, while their causal is just jyotmatra. When Self-Realisation takes place, the deities are awakened, and the chakras are nourished and freshened. They open out and start releasing energies. At the pithas (representative points of the chakras on our brain) all actions begin against each related chakra. Coordination at both levels starts and all chakras get integrated. Take an example of your mind. It wants to do something. Your body –it wants to do something else. Thirdly, your intellect – it wants to do something else. There is no integration. On realisation, all three become one. Take another example of a piece of cloth, it represents the attention.\n",

      "Sahaj Yogis are very honest, compassionate and diligent, good natured and have lesser temper. Their character has assumed a new dimension in this process of building up. Each one of you must work hard towards it and not bother too much about the other. Sthiti (state) is tested only when you are exposed to it. That is the time for ‘paristhiti’ (situation) sthiti (state) must be clubbed with complete discrimination. There are deities who are in the chakras. When Kundalini rises, she awakens them just like seeds. Once they are awakened, they start working it out. They know what is their job, what to work out, like they have been appointed. These deities you have achieved through your evolution at different points. So wherever they are settled, they do their job. Take a seed, it is gross. It has potential to become a tree and this has the potential to become numerous trees. So this potential is subtle to the subtler to subtlest. Its appearance is gross. The causal of mother earth is fragrance so when it awakens the Kundalini, it touches the causal also just like you get the fragrance. The causal of realisation is shuddha icha (pure desire). \n",

      "Man is made of three potentials i.e. gross, subtle and causal. This causal of realisation i.e. shuddha iccha enlightens the subtle and the gross bodies. Just like you put the seed into mother earth. The mother earth enlightens the seed and gives its potential to it, in the same way, the Kundalini is the mother earth in you. She rises and gives this potential dimension to your seed. Everything has different causal and so every chakra acts according to its own causal. The problem is, we do not understand it even on the grosser level. Now take a very gross level- you reach a point where to take an atom. This atom has nucleus which has protons, neutrons and mesotons.\n",

      "Now if you cool down this atom such as helium gas, the atom becomes collective. So also the mesotons act on their own, and even they become collective when cooled to a certain point. So even to the grosser and grosser, this potential exists. Scientifically it can be proved. When we take a human being, we are talking about a living process. The human being has most manifested one on the grosser level. Now, the inner growth has to come. On grosser level he is now fully manifested. Just take a seed which has reached its grosser level and is now living and pulsating and it is then put inside mother earth then what is to happen? Thus, the subtle and the subtlest is replicated in your whole being as such. The potential is the Kundalini. The Kundalini is representing the causal of mother earth. The causal of Virata is collectivity. The representatives of Sadashiva and Adi Shakti in us are Atma and the Kundalini [these are beyond the causal, in fact they excite the causal]. \n",

Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror; you look in the mirror and you’ll find you look like nothing on earth, it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything. But if you take a Belgian mirror, say, then the reflection is correct, full – but still not three dimensional. But this is a four dimensional reflection — four dimensional it is, what is called as turya state. And that four dimensional personality you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire. The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.\n",

But here, in England, I was really amazed, how it has worked out. So seekers are born everywhere, I see now this seeking is so deep and so much maddening for people. Of course, many people have made money out of it. That’s where I can’t understand. They have made marketing thing, you cannot market, you see, this is your evolutionary process. How much money do we go give to mother Earth for giving us these flowers? It is natural process of evolution, which has to take place in simple words it is ‘Sahaja’. Sahaja means spontaneous. It’s born with you. It is a great chance of becoming Sahaja Yogis. ‘Yoga’ means the union with the Divine. You get powers, it is not just to say ‘I am twice born’ - have some sort of sign board - but you become. Is the becoming is the point. You really become and in that becoming you get powers, you can raise the Kundalini of others you can cure people. I mean so many things happen.\n",

      "Shri Mataji: I said I see [may, many] thousands, because there not even thousand here. Now, these seekers are existing and they are seeking something beyond. But what are they seeking? In the tradition of spirituality, if you go back thousands of years, in the Upanishadas which eight thousands years back written down – before that it was just through the mouth – it is said that in you resides, in you resides the power to get your realisation, to get to your Self, and the Self is the one we should achieve. That’s why are on this Earth. That is why if you go to any village in India, not to cities because cities are more sort of westernized, but if you go to a village and ask a villager what does he want in his lifetime, so he will say that, “I want one sat guru” – is a guru who is a real guru – “and who will give me my realisation.” In the same tradition Christ came, two thousands years back we can say about. Of course, human beings were very cruel to Him. They didn’t allow Him to live long. In four years whatever was possible, He said all about it. He said, “To understand all this, you have to be born again.” And Nicodemus asked Him, “What do you mean by born again? Am I to enter into the womb of my mother?” He said, “Whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh. But Holy Ghost gives birth to the Spirit.” Now where is this Holy Ghost? It is placed, this one is the Kundalini. I asked a priest, I said, “What do you understand about Holy Ghost?” He said, “I, I, I am agnostic.” I said, “Then what are you doing here?” He said, “I am doing my job.” I mean, I was surprised at him that he didn’t want to know about it. So all these religions, all of them, have put blinkers on our eyes, and we are not supposed to see to the left or to the right.\n",

      "The third type of people are the seekers, the sattva gunis. They try to avoid extremes, they try to keep in the centre, they are the ones who are best seekers. Of course in seeking also people go astray. They go astray in so many ways. Like, they may like a person because he is giving them some sort of a workshop to work out, they like to work, they want to achieve something through work. They don't like something that is easily available. Sahaja Yoga, saha means 'with' and ja is 'born' with you. Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous, living happening of the evolutionary process within you, of the living God, is the living energy within you, which is this Kundalini, which is the true desire within you to become the Divine. How can you pay for this Kundalini, she doesn't understand money, like the Mother Earth [the sound drops out where Shri Mataji is telling the story of how Mother Earth germinates the seed]. In the same way, the Kundalini in her own nature awakens because she is your own mother. She is like a tape recorder which has taped everything that was your past. She's the one who is waiting for a chance to give you your second birth. This is what you have within yourself.\n",

The same way, from the state of a human being you go to a higher state, and to go that state you didn't have to work hard you didn't have to undergo any hardship. You didn't have to pay any money. The main thing is that God doesn't understand money at all. What will He do after taking money? What is the need of offering money in His name? The person who values money most, what is the use of giving money to him? For example, this land is earth put any seed into it, it will sprout on its own. The same way kundalini awakening takes place on its own in a sahaj way. But such things people explain that for kundalini jagran. You do this, you do that, you give so much money, do this, do that. It is all false, absolutely false. Do not trust such people at all. And those who take money in the name of God, commit sin. They commit the greatest sin.\n",

Secondly, the nature of a person changes entirely. I have seen people who have been very cruel, extremely aggressive become absolutely beautiful, compassionate, understanding personalities. All the arrogance drops like the thorns drop out, and a person blooms like a flower. People whom I have known, who have been very disturbed, very upset, even Grégoire when he first met Me, he was bundle of nerves. Very tense people suddenly become absolutely calm and peaceful. We don't have to talk about peace, you just become peaceful. Today we are talking about wars and no wars; there is no need to bother about it once you get realised people on this earth.

She sucks in all our problems very easily. During this experience, you have to keep your eyes shut, but before that I will tell you how you yourself are going to awaken your own Kundalini. The left-hand represents the desire to be one with the Divine. Say, we can say the desire power is on the left side. And the right side − right-hand − is the one which represents the action, power of action. So what you have to do is to put the left-hand on the table like this all the time, but be comfortable about it, but straight.\n",

Just be comfortable and you have to sit strait without bending your head left or right or front or backward, just keep it strait. Now you have to close your eyes because if you don’t close your eyes the Kundalini won’t rise. Because something has to happen inside, the whole attention is sucked in, it is better to keep your eyes shut. The left-hand represents your desire and your right-hand represents your action. So what you have to do is put your left-hand on your lap towards me all the time and we’ll work on…with the right-hand we are going to work on the left-hand side centres within ourselves. Now it is very simple to work it out you don’t have to do much about it. The only thing is to release your chakras from augmentation. You have to little bit give the vibrations to particular centres which are very simple. One is on the heart; one is on the upper part of the stomach, another on the lower part of the stomach. Another is from the front side you have to put your hand about the spinal cord, here at the base of the neck, on the shoulder. This is the one you are all feeling because you feel guilty. And then one here and one here. Sometimes I may ask you to put the hand at the back also if it is catching. So let us see, it is very simple.

You can cure others. That is how one enlightened light can enlighten other lights. It’s a natural process. Just like a seed. If you put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself. Because in the seed it is built in to sprout and it is in the Mother Earth – the power is there to sprout. This is how everything is built in within you. It is spontaneous, means Sahaj. Means it is born with you, this right to have this union, yoga, with this divine Power. When we think, we think about the past or the future. We cannot be in the present which is the reality. Because the past is finished the future doesn’t exist. But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts and establishes the silence in between them. That time you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware. You are aware but you are thoughtless. You want to think, you can think. You don’t want to think, you need not think. But inspirations start coming. This state is the state of peace within yourself.\n",

As I said this is the time when the Mother of the Universe came on this Earth long long time back to fight all kinds of evil people, devils – to kill them, to save human beings who were trying to ascent from the green thing is we call as the Bhavasagara- is the place where you became from amoeba to the human level. That’s the ocean of illusion. So she came to help you to fight the evil forces. That time human beings were better people. There were two types of people. One was evil and another was good. But today the people are good and evil mixed up. In the brain of the good people evil has gone. It’s a very complicated brain these days of human beings. Not simple as it used to be. Become so complicated now that first, you have to take out the evil from the mind and then you can make the Kundalini rise. This is the problem. Problem is much more complicated today than it was before. So one has to understand that by…through mental projection you cannot reach there.

Look at our eyes, which is a camera, and the brain is a computer; how did we get all these things? We take everything for granted. Who does all this living work? We never ever think. And Science cannot answer. Science has its own limitations. It cannot say why are you here and what is your purpose of life? It cannot, it cannot answer this. Unless and until you get this answer you will be restless, you will be nervous, you will be upset, you will be insecure till you find out the answer why are we here. So these miracles take place spontaneously because the seed has the built in quality to sprout and the Mother Earth has the built in quality to sprout it. It just works out. We can say that Mother Earth is a living thing; She is also potentially living.

But do you know that Christ resides in the centre here, in the Optic Chasma in the centre here on the cross of the Optic Chasma? That is the gate through which everybody has to pass. When the Kundalini rises, she enlightens Him, she awakens Him and when He is awakened, He sucks in your ego and superego as shown in the picture, completely. And space is made here at the fontanel where you have the soft bone like a child, so that your Karmas, or your bad deeds or so-called sins or your aggressiveness everything, is sucked in. Because Christ suffered for it. Why should we suffer when he has already suffered for us. Are we going to suffer more than Him?

      "If you have to sprout a seed, you just put it in the Mother Earth and She sprouts it. How much money do you give Her? She doesn’t understand money. She only knows how to sprout the seed. So when you put the seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts spontaneously, Sahaja. Saha means with, ja means born. It is born within you the capacity to sprout; the capacity to awaken your Kundalini is born with you.\n",

      "So the second proof is that there is the subtle power of divine love which does all the living work. If you take a seed and put it in the mother Earth it sprouts spontaneously, Sahaja! You don't have to do anything. Because this Mother Earth has the power to sprout the seed, and the seed has the power to get sprouted. In the same way, we have the Kundalini within us, which sprouts itself. You should not be shocked. If you are the people of the Chinese tradition, you should know - what Tao has said? They said…the Lao Tse…’This mind is a myth’. That is this mind is created, out of the reaction through our conditioning's or our ego! But there is no reality. Now [unclear] this reaction still travels] in the brain, which is the truth, of course. But it builds in our own brain and creates this so-called mind, which is nothing but like bubbles of thoughts. All the ideas of war, and fighting, and quarrelling, all these are born in these bubbles with our tortured mind. So you have to cross over that mind, you have to go beyond the mind to reach the reality. They said that in a great [unclear] like Hong Kong, how can you go beyond the mind? and can do your business? All the mess you see of today's business, recession and all kinds of nonsense it is because of the using of the mind [unclear] which is defected. It's, we create through our reaction, this mind…like we create a… say the watch and then we are afraid of the watch. We create a computer, and we are slaves of the computer. In the same way, this mind dominates us, and which is the relative entity within us. It's not the absolute. \n",

Tobacco is nothing but a kind of a virus, is a kind of a vegetable which has gone out of the circle of evolution. But he has put it Surati for Kundalini while people use this word surati for tobacco very openly. This shows how we have misused all these great incarnations and all their great teachings. And now people say, ‘Look at this. This is religion.’ What is this religion? It makes you fight. Is this religion that makes you do all kinds of nonsensical things? Is it religion that makes you sick? This is not the religion which was propounded by those great people. We should not bring bad name to them.

      "There has been a discussion about Kundalini everywhere. However, it was possible only between one Guru and one disciple. It was concealed in such a way that one Guru would have only one disciple. In the 12th century, Gnyaneshwar took the permission of his Guru and wrote everything about the Kundalini in the 6th chapter of his book Gyaneshwari. But the so-called protectors of religion. discouraged people from reading it proclaiming it as forbidden, since they themselves did not know much about it. This is how the knowledge was suppressed again. Then in the 16th century, Guru Nanaka, Kabira and several saints of Maharashtra clearly described about the Kundalini, and that man’s benevolence and ascent is not possible without the awakening of Kundalini. Several tantrikas arose and claimed knowledge about the Kundalini. People started hovering around them. When I came to this earth, I found that most people are in a state of turmoil and disturbed. For instance, my own father was an extremely pure soul, even my mother never told a lie. I have seen such people.\n",

      "Now I have to tell you about our own things, as it has been told that, what you have within is these powers. You'll be amazed, all this was known long time back in our country but all that knowledge was finished because of the British rule, you can say, or the other rules that came in, that they didn't care for all this. But there were group of people called as Nathpanthis, they knew this, that Kundalini awakening is the only way you can get your Self-Realisation. But the idea about Self-Realisation was so limited and was so absurd that people didn't want to do it. They said you have to give up your family, you have to give up your all, everything, your property, everything. You have to become absolutely single. You should have nothing to do with your relations. All these funny ideas came into the heads of so many people who wanted to propagate their way of thinking. All such thinking has ruined actually the reality that exist within us, absolutely. Because to say that you give up that and give up this and all this kind of a nonsensical ideas: doesn't happen. You don't give up. It's all there, you just have an outward feeling that you have given it, say to your guru or to someone and that's how all kinds of fraudulent things have started with this kind of a theory. You don't have to give up anything, is the point. That, just now as you are, this Kundalini exists within you. She is your Mother. She is your individual Mother. You are the only child She has and you don't have to give up anything as such. Because She's the one who looks after you. She is going to give your second birth. And when your mother gave you the second birth, did she trouble you? She took up all the trouble upon herself and she managed that you are born on this earth. In the same way, for the second birth, as you call dwija, that is born twice, to be born again, there is a Mother already placed within you. She exists within you and She is the one who can give you Self-Realisation.\n",

      "So one should forget about obligations and forget about paying for it. Then we have to understand that everything that is living has happened spontaneously, absolutely spontaneously. Because if you want to sprout a seed, what you have to do is to sprout the seed. Just put it in the Mother Earth. The Mother Earth has the capacity to raise it. Within us is placed this Mother Earth, the representation of that is the Holy Ghost, the essence of Mother Earth, which is the Kundalini, which does the job. It does. It happens spontaneously. You don't have to stand on your head. You have to dance. Nothing of the kind. You don't have to change dresses, nothing. It is all within yourself, it happens. But to awaken this, it was necessary that somebody has to do the job because somebody has to decode it. Somebody has to tell about it, and somebody has to communicate and have a rapport about otherwise. How will you know how to do it. Because even for the seed to be sprouted, the showers have to come, so somebody who has this power already awakened in him can put that shower on the seed so the seed can sprout. But once you get it, you can do it and many can do it. And as you can see, there are so many people who have come all the way from London to meet you who have got it and they are doing very good work there. \n",

      "And then the answer came to me from a priest. I asked him, he’s a nice man, he’s a Realised-soul now and he’s working for Sahaja Yoga. But he told me, ‘The reason in the Bible it is written is that, ‘Whatever is corrected on this earth will be corrected in the heaven’.’ That’s why you’d better correct it by telling to the priest! Now by any logical means do you think this priest can correct you by telling them anything? Whatever is to be corrected on this earth is your Kundalini and your chakras. If the language of Bible has been, especially the Old Testament, has been extremely guarded, it was a security measure. Like, the Tree of Life is nothing but the Kundalini which is enlightened. Absolutely, it is that, it looks like that, like a tree. \n",

      "Like Christ used donkey just to suggest the mind that if you allow it to go astray it will take you to all kinds of things, but if you control it, it takes you there where you have to go. You just make him keep quiet. It’s better to keep quiet at mind level. And that’s why I answered your questions because later on when the Kundalini’s rising, at that time, the mind should not stand up, isn’t it, to say that ‘I haven’t asked this question.’ That’s why. Just to soothe it – there’s no need – but, just to soothe it down, I do it. All right? So best thing is to get your realisation is the best thing, otherwise this mind is quite a disturbing stuff. It can come at the right time, when you are going to achieve your last breakthrough, it may stop. All right? So if you have any immediate question by which you are really oppressed then you must ask Me. But if it is not so important, just give up. Is it very important? Then it’s all right. He has realised it. Now, I have to just request you one thing, if you don't mind, we have to take out our shoes, because the mother earth has such a lot, you see, so we have to take her help in every way possible. \n",

What happens that the centres get enlightened. Then they get integrated, and when it pierces through the fontanel bone area it becomes one with this all-pervading Power. Now we all these beautiful flowers here but we just take them for granted we just don't understand that how different flowers are grown differently in a different manner from the same soil.

      "When, this Kundalini energy is awakened for the first time. It happens very spontaneously. Its rises in the central channel, the Sushumna and pierces the fontanelle. Mainly, there are three channels in our body. The awakening of the Kundalini happens in the central channel. Everything in the world is pulled downwards towards the earth, only fire goes upwards. But this is a silent fire, full of peace. This is God’s greatest miracle. When this energy rises upwards, the chakras open up automatically; you don’t have to do anything. Spontaneously, when you sow a seed in the earth, do you pay money to Mother Earth? Do you pay your salutations to her? It is her dharma, innate quality to germinate whatever is sowed in her womb. Even the seed also has the innate quality of germinating. And so, germinates by its self.\n",

When she rises, she enlightens them. She nourishes them, also She integrates them, that’s how we become an integrated personality. This has to happen to you, not just some sort of a madness that people are doing in the name of seeking. You become a saner person, you become a better person, you become a self-confident person and you understand your value, what is your value, why are you on this earth.

She's very kind, She's the kindest thing that you can think of. Now, please put both the feet apart from each other, because the left side is for your power of desire, ordinary desire – Kundalini is for pure desire – and the right side is for your action. Now we'll tell you in the beginning, how we're going to proceed and then you can close your eyes. I hope you're pleasantly placed towards yourself. Now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, on your lap very comfortably. You don't have to do anything which is troublesome or painful, just like this and the right hand on your heart. Left hand on your lap and right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit and if this Spirit comes into your attention, then you have the light of the Spirit and in that light you become your own guide, you become your own master, you become your own guru. So please, now take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Now, this is the centre of your mastery which is created by great masters for you. Now, please take your right hand the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side. This is the centre for pure knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have, is not pure knowledge but this is pure knowledge because it gives you the knowledge about the laws of the Divine. It makes you capable of working it out. This is the pure knowledge you should have. Of course, we have another kind of knowledge, as you know, is black magic, this and that, but this is pure knowledge of the Divine.\n",

Before this there was no time that people could get mass evolution. Normally also in the evolutionary process, one fish came out and started crawling, then about few came out and then [unclear] of fishes came out. Seeking today is the maximum, it was never so before. But it gets diverted and deviated. The happening of yoga is a living process. Is a living process of evolution. Like this mother Earth you put one seed, it sprouts by itself, it’s a miracle. Who does that? Who creates these flowers? Is this Paramchaitanya - this all-pervading Power of divine love? So, this separation of two things, one side is this physical growth and physical working out, and on the other side the emotional working out, through bhakti could not balance human beings. \n",

It is built in the Earth that she can sprout a seed, and also in the seed it is built in, that it sprouts. So firstly, you cannot pay for any yoga. You can pay for the hall, you can pay for electricity. But can't pay for an evolutionary process which is spontaneously within you -works out your last breakthrough. And if you are sincerely seeking it works in no time. Even the ‘nath panthis’ who were quite depth in it and travelled to so many countries, like Macchindranath, Gorakhnath, they too could not raise the Kundalini of the masses. Actually, the tradition was that one guru has only one disciple. And it was hazardous, we have to go through so much of disciplining and all kinds of fasting and all kinds of things that people got fed up with it. Recently I have read a very interesting book by an American called as ‘Peaceful Warrior’, is a story of an athlete and the person who took to this Zen system of ascent. And he has to, really if you read that book you get such a fright because this poor fellow, this young fellow had to go for years together for various things and do all kinds of horrible things - ultimately, he receives his realisation. This is, he says ‘that I reached my ‘Satori’ state’.\n",

How are we to understand why we are human beings today? Just once, internalise and evaluate why we are human beings today. Why were we the chosen ones? Why didn’t all the snakes on Earth get a chance to be human beings? Why are they still snakes? So many chimpanzees and monkeys, even lions, all kinds of animals are existing. Why were we few beings chosen to be humans? When we think thoroughly about this, all those who have ascended are focused towards their goals. Those who want to get Self-Realisation and want to be the Spirit must be very few people. But this is our ascent. In Delhi there are so many people but how many are seeking their ascent? So many beings have been turned into humans, and yet so many still are organisms, or are left in animal form. It can happen that so many people get Self-Realisation and yet remain human beings. They do not rise up to be super humans. This is a big problem, especially for Me! This thing I cannot assimilate. Any human being who may belong to any nationality or caste, be of any skin colour, whatever kind of thinking process he has, can get their Self-Realisation. To attain your Self-Realisation is of the utmost importance. This is one very big warning in front of you today, that how many people today want to attain their Self-Realisation? Want to attain a state which is described by sages and deities, and when today the time has come that we can attain that place, should we miss such a chance? This power called the Kundalini is within each one of us. By its awakening, and by its awakening you all can reach that state, and in that very moment you can attain the state.\n",

Can you say that, ‘All right, I read these mantras to you, or Bible to you,’ or do this? Will it rise? No, it won’t. It’s a living process. You have to place it in the Mother Earth [and] spontaneously it will rise. You don’t have to say anything. You don’t have to imagine anything. It will rise. And that’s what it is, that this Kundalini has to be awakened in the same manner, in the living process.\n",

      "What can you pay? It's something so natural − it's a living process and what do we pay to this Mother Earth for sprouting a seed − She doesn't understand even. So you can't pay for it − first of all understand that it is not something material that you can buy but it's your own energy which has to manifest it. Tomorrow, of course, I'm going to tell you about what is the nature of the Spirit but today I've just to tell you one thing that this Kundalini is within you and when She rises, She definitely solves your physical, mental, emotional problems, also your material problems but above all your spiritual urge. They say that, in this Kali Yuga, ghor Kali Yuga − these modern times − this work will be done − is already been predicted that people who were seeking the truth in the hills and dales will find it within themselves, as ordinary householders. And that's what I find, is so easy. The time is such that it is working out in such great numbers. Surprisingly, in a place, which we call the country called Russia where they had never heard about God, they were not supposed to think about God, they were not supposed to even utter the word God where thousands and thousands have got realisation and such seeking. I was wondering, what is the thing that they have that they should in thousands should come to these lectures of Mine and I had to arrange them in stadiums − never in a hall like this.

He was Mahavishnu, He was specially made. That's why on Easter day they make an egg. If you ask a Christian man, \"Why do you give an egg on Easter day?\" They won't be able to tell you. But it is in the Purana of Devi that you can find out that He was first made like an egg. He is born, gradually his pituitary starts working and he collects lot of ego on top of his head. So ego and superego, both of them meet in the fontanel bone area and you develop a calcified thing here, I mean this cranial box, and you become a person with your 'I's. Like, \"I'm Mr. so, Mrs. so\", like, \"I am a citisen of this and I am a Christian or a Hindu or I am an Indian or Englishman\", all these you see, separate identities start crawling into you and you become like a box or like an egg. Now this egg has to grow. When it is ready enough then only just like we call a Brahmin a \"dweeja.\" A brahmin who is not a \"dweeja\" is called a brahmin in the Shastras, he is called as a brahmin. He is not a brahmin, he is a a brahmin. That \"a\" has to go away. Till he gets his realisation, he is still a a brahmin. So when this breaks, this egg breaks into a new being, when you become a new being, you are called the \"dweeja\" and a bird is also-called a \"dweeja\" means twice born. But there are many people I met, they say, \"We are already twice born.\" Is also false certification, \"We are twice born.\" What, what do you mean by twice born? You cannot just give a certificate to yourself. If you are twice born then what is the specialty? What do you get as a twice born personality?\n",

She is your own individual mother. She knows everything about you. Like a tape recorder, she has taped all that you have aspired, all that was your past. So, it’s your own power, which is to be awakened. It is like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth and sprouts by itself. Now, the problem is that you have to understand that what life we are having today is extremely chaotic. Chaotic. You don’t know about your children, what drugs they will take. You don’t know about anyone; what wrong life they have lived. By forcing people to take to morality doesn’t work out at all.

It is spontaneous. When we sow a seed in the Mother earth what do we do? Nothing we sow it because the Mother earth has a built-in power to germinate, and the seed has the built in power to get germinated. So this is your own power within you in the sacrum bone surprisingly Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone so they called it sacrum, and it rises very smoothly without troubling you all these books that describe that kundalini awakening is a horrible experience I have never seen that before − It is not so − She is your mother that is the what you call the feminine Divine power, she is your individual mother and she knows everything about you, she is like a tape that has taped everything you have been doing whatever you are aspiring. This is a gift we have that we have to be connected to this all-pervading Power. Like this instrument if it is not connected to the mains, it cannot be used, in the same way we have to be connected to that great power so that we know ourselves and also know others as well as we know what Divine love is.\n",

It has to manifest and when it manifests you will get it. That's the thing, that has to work out. It's a primordial force within us which works it out. That's all. But how it works out, how can you tell? Because you can see with your naked eyes it's rising. It's a thing that's pulsating. You see the pulsation on top of your head as Kabira has said: \"A shoonya shikhir per anhad baje re\". On the head you start feeling the throbbing and then you feel the cool breeze coming out of your own being. Surprising, isn't it? But it happens, it does happen. It's very simple to sprout a seed, isn't it? But how it works out must be very complicated and the capacity that the Mother Earth has, if somebody has the same capacity you can get your Realisation, why can't you? But the best part of Sahaja Yoga today is that you get the power, you can do it, you can give Realisation, you can work it out, your own powers manifest. Any other question?\n",

Just like, I would say, if you have seen the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo.

      "Yesterday I told you how it works out through Kundalini awakening. About Kundalini people have written all kinds of nonsensical things which is not true. I am your Mother, I’m going to tell you truth, I’m not going to tell you something false. Even if you don’t like it let Me tell you, because this is for your benevolence, for your good, for your hita. So when the Kundalini rises, She passes through your different centres which are subtle centres, and nourishes them, pierces through your fontanel bone area and connects you to the all-pervading Power, about which we do not know. Then from your hands you feel vibrations, which are called as Chaitanya lahari. Adi Shankaracharya has called it ‘Saundarya lahari,’ because you can judge the saundarya with this. Beautifully he has described it. But how much they tortured him – think of it, person like Adi Shankaracharya – I mean, I don’t know what to say. The one who gave such secrets about the Mother, such great descriptions; he was tortured for what? What wrong did he do that he should have been tortured? Now we have to stand up with the truth, and must say that, ‘Mother, we have to have the truth, and truth and nothing else.’ I told you yesterday that Atma is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart. In these days of scientific conditioning this is a new type, apart from the ‘dharmic’ scientific conditioning in which every scientist thinks that he knows everything. They don’t know anything, take it from Me. Is absurd. Now you have seen so many scientists coming up and telling you about Sahaja Yoga. They have accepted because they have experimented. I told them that Mooladhara Chakra, the first chakra, Mooladhara, is made of carbon atoms, because it is made of Prithvi [earth] tattwa. And if you photograph the carbon atom and make a model out of it and then take photograph, say, from left side, you’ll see the right side, and you’ll see actually ‘AUM’ written down. If you see it from the right side, on the left side you will see a swastika. But if you see from down upward, you will see a cross. \n",

Similarly, we too have this live process in us, and this live process takes place in us. It can happen in a person only when the power which can activate is present before him. This power is not like electricity. Does electricity understand what I am saying? This is the power of love. This is the Almighty’s love. So, it understands everything. It knows who I am. It also knows who you are. It also knows what all mistakes you have committed. It is all taped within you. She is your tape. But she is your Mother and she is only your Mother. Your Kundalini is your Mother. She does not have another son or daughter. You are her child and you are her everything. She has no interest beyond this. Anyhow, this child of Mine should take another birth is what She struggles for, birth after birth. And that is what She does. \n",

      "If we do not connect this machine to the mains then it will not work. It will not have power. All the labour, whatever hard work we put in to make this, will all go waste. What the Almighty has made you by putting in hard work, till you understand its meaning and know what you are, till then you too will go waste. So, you should get connected to God. ‘Sahaj’ means since birth. Your relation of being one with God is your birth right. It is in you since your birth. This resides in you in the form of a seedling, in the form of a power, in the form of Kundalini. But this Kundalini too does not get awakened normally. It is beyond dispute. If you give a seed to a savage person and he does not have an inkling about trees. If you tell him that that this large tree has grown from this seed, then he will say how is it possible. He will break it, demolish it. Will say that we tried to penetrate it still we did not understand. If this power was there, would have seen it. But if you give it to a gardener, he knows that after placing it in the womb of mother earth, it will sprout. Because it has this power in a dormant form. That is why a mother’s form is needed. Because mother is ready to toil. To get upset, to get angry is very easy. But people find it difficult to love. I don’t at all feel it difficult. Also, the awakening of Kundalini will happen only in those people who themselves are loving. Those who do not have love, who do not have presence of God in them, those who do not have the right for this, Kundalini will not get awakened before them. \n",

But they themselves didn’t know that in that temple why they sang ‘Jogawa,’ which said that ‘O Ambe, awaken.’ Ambe is the Kundalini. So why in Mahalakshmi’s temple they sang? You can understand that, why in that temple they started singing the song of ‘Jogawa’ by which to raise the Kundalini.\n",

      "Somehow or other I could manage a method by which you could raise the Kundalini of masses. So when the Kundalini rises, what She does, She connects you to this all-pervading Power. Now this all-pervading Power is doing all living work. Look at these flowers − we take them for granted. Look at our eye − we take it for granted. It's a big work, great work of a very delicate camera. What about your brain, which is another great computer: already programmed. But we just accept it, or we just know it, and do not want to know how it works. All the living processes we accept blindfolded and we are not at all concerned as to know how, how these flowers have come out of the Mother Earth, how their heights are maintained, how their colours are reproduced − from a small, little seed. All this comes to us because we do not know about it. But this all-pervading Power which they are talking about, pure love, that pure love is the one, that energy that does all these beautiful delicate things. Once you are connected with that, your Spirit gets enlightened, in the sense it is an enlightenment, but it enlightens your attention. As your attention enlightens, you become a different personality altogether. First of all, you become collectively conscious, means you know about others also; you know about your own centres on your fingertips, also you know about others – their subtle centres, what is their problem. Now these centres are the ones which are the foundations of our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. When you put these centres right, you are all right. That's how you know here in Delhi, we have two doctors, and third one is coming up, who have got their M.D. in cures of Sahaja Yoga. \n",

      "Many diseases, which are supposed to be incurable, can be easily cured in Sahaja Yoga. Because this Kundalini, when She passes through these six centres, She enlightens those centres, nourishes those centres and integrates them − so in totality you are all right. It's not like, that one part of the body is treated, another part is neglected − in totality, in the whole balance. And She puts you in the central path of balance. Of course, with this light you become, definitely, a very wise person because your mind, you can empty it any time, which we call as thoughtless awareness. At that time, you become absolutely peaceful. After little working out, this connection, when it is established well, then you become a person, which we call as full of doubtless awareness. Means you become so powerful, you can give realisation to others, you can cure people, you can talk about Sahaja Yoga as your own knowledge. It's true, I have guided whenever they asked Me questions and things about it. But so much has come from within, and the enlightenment has told them that, these scriptures are very different from the way the people are following them. They can now see the enlightenment of these great souls who came on this earth to help us. So in the evolutionary process now, we are just standing on the edge of our last breakthrough and that is Self-Realisation, and the whole world has to get it. \n",

      "Shri Mataji: That's a good question. Where is it coming from? That's a real good question − how the Kundalini is to be awakened. Now, it's a living process in a human being. And acts spontaneously. It's a living process, it is not a process of some sort of a mechanical thing. It's a living process, just like sprouting the seed. And it automatically works within you. Only thing is like a seed you have to put in the Mother Earth, and She sprouts it. So those who have got the authority to do it from the Divine − not from any theological college or anything like that − but from the Divine, they also can raise your Kundalini. Then, once you get enlightened you can enlighten another person. Just in the presence of that person it can happen.\n",

      "The third condition is also very simple, is that those who are wearing shoes have to take it out, because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Those who are sitting on the ground should also take out their shoes. But those who are sitting on a chair have to keep both the feet apart from each other like this, because there are two powers, left and right. Left is the power of our desire, mundane desire. Kundalini is the Power of pure desire. And the right side is the power of action. If you have pure desire, I'm sure it will work out. So, you have to place both the feet apart from each other; on the ground, you are all right. Sit comfortably, that's all. Don't put strain on your body of bending back too much or slouching in front. You should be really pleasantly placed towards yourself. You are about to enter into the Kingdom of God. Now, somebody will show you how we'll nourish our centres. [unclear] we should say.\n",

      "They say that Sahaj Yoga is working in one hundred and eight countries where I’ve not been. I’ve been to many but not so many. Only the people who got their realisation went down to all these places and have given awakening to so many people. It’s something that is within you. This Kundalini is your own mother. She’s your individual mother. She knows everything about you. She’s very anxious to give you your Self-Realisation. As your mother took all the pains when you were born, she takes all the pain. She’s so anxious that if she knows that there is an atmosphere that she can awaken your inner being, she spontaneously rises and doesn’t give you any trouble whatsoever. It’s a living process of evolution as I told you. We cannot explain any living process in a very scientific method because supposing you have a seed, and you plant it in the mother Earth, it sprouts. Because the mother Earth has got power to sprout it and the seed has got power to be sprouted. It is no effort. The seed is to be treated with respect and it has to be planted inside the mother Earth. It is a very simple thing. Now, people think that how can it be so simple. For them it should be a very difficult thing. But everything vital in this world is simple. For example, our breathing. Supposing for our breathing we had to do some or take some lessons, or consult some books, what would have happened? It’s a very vital thing which has to happen, and that’s why it is very simple. I think these are the times I call them as blossom time, where suddenly so many seekers have come and the Kundalini is taking this form. Of course, it is predicted also by Kundalini long time back that such and such thing will happen. But still it will happen in such a big proportion I could never have guessed.\n",

      "They have already explained to you about the mechanism that works out this wonderful thing called Self-realisation. Also we have a book in which you can read about it, clearly. But all that reading is not going to help, it's the happening that has to take place. If this does not take place, I am sorry for it, but it has to work out. One can sprout the seed, but you have to look after it. You have to respect your Self-realisation. And you should allow it to grow. It happens, I don't know why, in the West, because people do not have the background, that once they get realised they feel very happy, and live in that happiness for about three or four days, and then slowly they find they've lost their vibrations and the Kundalini has come down. 42:13 We like to change all the time, but it's very different in your spiritual seeking. If you find the right person, like if you find the water under Mother Earth, then you must dig it deep there, no use making holes all over. Yesterday I gave a lot of time for you people to ask me questions, and even now if you have any questions, you can write them and we'll try to answer them in our centres. \n",

      "Now whatever has come to us through our spiritual self, in evolutionary knowledge about divinity. Through all the scriptures one after another they came on this earth to tell you the new evolution. Evolution is a very different thing from some sort of a thing that a new fad starts. Evolution comes like the step-by-step growth. It is the steps are important, that traditionally whatever is coming up is actually the essence is kept the same and the growth is gradual till you lead to a certain point where you realise why the growth was there. But it is not that you just get something from out of the way and talk about it. For example the other day a gentleman came to Me suffering from epilepsy and in a horrid way and he would not sit on the ground properly because he said his Kundalini is awakened and he was jumping like a frog. He is a PhD I tell you he needs to become now a MAD. I asked him, “How is it that you think you'll become a frog now? Do you think you are going to become a frog after becoming human being” He said, “No.” He said, “It is written in a book”. I said, “Which book?” He told me a name of a gentleman whom I had never heard about. I said, “Who is this gentleman?” He said you get a shaktipa. I said what is a shafrapa?” Which this gentleman has described a shafrada tell Me. Any scripture [which/witch doctor]. How is it suddenly hundred years back, the whole tradition of today's seeking is only a hundred-year-old. A hundred years. Whatever these hundred years these mad people have done, people think that is God, that is religion, that is divinity because they are futuristic people. We do not see there has to be a shakrada. There has to be an evolutionary process. It doesn't come from somewhere. It's not a plastic flower. It is a real flower which has to grow on a real tree on a living tree, which has got a living force behind it. And ultimately it comes to that flowering and then it becomes the fruit. And that's why you have seen people who do all these kind of neo businesses and it seems like that go into trouble. Of course the interest of the people is that they might be making money out of it, or maybe they are trying to have some sort of a power over others or I don't know whatever their interest is. But it is so short-lived stuff that it has no tradition behind it and you should find out what is the tradition of Divinity to begin with if you are people who are using your mental projection.\n",

Their intelligence is much sharper than ours. We are mediocre because we are satisfied with mediocrity. But if you could just understand one thing which is the subtle present of this great country of Mine is that this is a yoga. This is a country where great saints have walked their feet. This is a vibrated country. This is a country where all the Gods are residing. This is a specially blessed country which is so blessed that anybody who touches this Mother Earth of Mine here gets his realisation. It's such a blissful country this one is. Now as it is the present gross may be horrified – maybe. But the present subtle of this country is so great. You have no idea where you are living. You have no idea how this country was made.
